Right now, `_sig_on` is a macro.  However, in the light of future changes at #9678, it would be better to make it have function syntax and write `_sig_on()` instead.  The same for `_sig_off`.  While we're at it, why not drop the leading underscore and make it `sig_on()`?  The `sig_on` macro/function isn't really "private", it's used all over the place and it should be used by users writing their own Cython code.

So in this ticket, I would simpy change the syntax from `_sig_on` to `sig_on()` without changing what it does.

This will prepare the way for #9678 when `sig_on()` will actually become an inline function (there are several reasons why this would be better).
