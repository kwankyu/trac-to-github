This patch implements the principal and exponential specialisations for symmetric functions as given in Stanley, Enumerative Combinatorics, Section 7.8.

Unfortunately, the patch currently has several problems:
1) it seems that always the default code in sf/sfa.py is called
2) I do not know how to give the desired default argument 1 the correct type in exponential_specialization
3) I guess one should rather implement this for quasi-symmetric functions, but I do not know enough about these currently
