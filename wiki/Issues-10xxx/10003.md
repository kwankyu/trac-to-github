Sometimes I would like to use multi-line text inputs for interacts, and to be able to see at least a few lines of that input.  

This ticket extends the input_box control to handle this by using a textarea instead of an input element when a parameter "height" (the number of rows) is greater than 1.

Two quick comments just from reading the patch:

* The docs say about height: "If greater than 1 a value won't be returned until something outside the textarea is clicked." -- is this not true when the height is 1?  If it's true with height=1 and height>1, then there's no reason for this comment.

OK, I'll put the height behind the width.

The behavior is different with a height > 1, because for height=1 a <input> element is used and then pressing return updates the value.  For height > 1, a <textarea> element is used and then pressing return just gives a newline within the textarea.

Thanks for taking a look.
