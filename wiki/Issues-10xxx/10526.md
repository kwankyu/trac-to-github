**Attachment:** [10526_reviewer.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket10526/10526_reviewer.patch)

The following is a cleaner solution, in my opinion:

```
             if hgridlines=="minor":
                hgridstyle['which']="both"
             if vgridlines=="minor":
                vgridstyle['which']="both
```

I don't think we want to do that.  It won't let us set the gridlines independently.  Say we want minor horizontal ticks and major vertical ticks.  We only want to set both when `_both_` are 'minor'
