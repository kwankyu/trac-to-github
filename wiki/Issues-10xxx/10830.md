The '-r' is unnecessary on the 'cp' command. 

I think I know what you are trying to achieve, but be warned this syntax would never work if there were pdf files in sub-directories. Luckily in this case there are not, so a simple 'cp', with no options, will do. 

If there were however any PDFs in sub-directories, and it was not possible to do a simple cp -r, because of other files, then one would probably use 'find' to locate the PDF files and tar to copy them from one place and put them in another. The syntax for doing this is non-trivial, and would be something like that below, where one:

* Uses 'find' to find all the PDF files.
* Uses 'tar' to create an archive of the PDF files, but instead of writing it to an intermediate file, one writes the archive on standard output.
* Uses 'cd' to change to the directory where the files need to be extracted.
* Uses 'tar', which reads from standard input, to extract the files written by the other tar. 

```
tar cf - `find doc -name '*.pdf'` | ( cd "$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/pari"; tar xfp -)
```

Note the above is untested. 

In this case, simply remove the '-r' and what you have will be get a positive review. 

Dave
