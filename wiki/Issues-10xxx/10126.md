From `sage/matrix/matrix_rational_dense.pyx`:

```
# unfortunately I can't get signal handling to be good enough
# to properly catch error (and clean up) when trying to
# compute inverse, so we have to compute rank.  This does add
# time... (!) :-(
```

This is fixed by #15124.

Component: **linear algebra**

Keywords: **pari sig_on interrupt exception**
