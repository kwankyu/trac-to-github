```
This gives an error:

```
sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.6, Release Date: 2010-10-30'
sage: import datetime
sage: datetime.timedelta(hours=6)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/grout/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: unsupported type for timedelta hours component: sage.rings.integer.Integer

```

but this does not

```
sage: datetime.timedelta(hours=int(6))
datetime.timedelta(0, 21600)
```

Is this possible to fix without patching Python?

There's no way to do this without patching Python.  The timedelta function has explicit `PyInt_Check`, `PyLong_Check`, and `PyFloat_Check`.  So, unless we make integer a subclass of int/long, this won't work without an upstream change.
