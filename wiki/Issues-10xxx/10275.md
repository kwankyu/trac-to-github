From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/60ce4391e54e74be?tvc=2): Something is not quite right in the cleverness used to output matrices: 

```
sage: M 
76 x 58 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print M.str()' to see all of the entries) 
sage: M.hermite_form() 
76 x 58 dense matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print hnf-True-False.str()' to see all of the entries)
```
This issue arises with methods which cache their results (like hermite_form), whereas other methods (like transpose) work the way they're supposed to.  The proposed fix: 

- in the function `sage_variablename` which tries to get the name of an object, only return strings which are valid identifiers for Python objects.

- then in the caching methods for matrices, make sure the keys are not valid identifiers by appending a symbol like "$".
