Currently sagenb/spkg_dist contains the following function:

```
def fetch_packages():
    # This block is here in case we ever need it again.
    # XXX Then also make sure the easy_install commands
    # XXX get written to the correct part of spkg-install!
    # XXX (We currently use a single string for the whole file.)
    print "Fetching the required packages"
    pkg_index = PackageIndex()

    tmp_dir = mkdtemp()

    required_packages = ()

    pkg_locations = []

    for pkg in required_packages:
        print "Fetching %s" % pkg
        dist = pkg_index.fetch_distribution(Requirement.parse(pkg), tmp_dir,
                                            True, True)
        pkg_locations.append(os.path.abspath(dist.location))

    for location in pkg_locations:
        shutil.copy(location, 'src')
        spkg_install_fd.write('easy_install %s\n' % os.path.basename(location))

    return [os.path.basename(location) for location in pkg_locations]
```

Iterating over () and [] should be fixed; however, the function is never called. Therefore, this patch simply removes the function.
