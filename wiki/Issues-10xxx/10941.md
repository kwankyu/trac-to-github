This ticket puzzles me. On my research group's Sage box (not as powerful as sage.math but less heavily loaded, thus faster in practice), `ModularSymbols(N).cuspidal_subspace().decomposition()` takes so long even for `N = 500` or so that it's somehow not even conceivable that it could finish in any reasonable time for `N = 4727`. I tried, and it's been running for 16 hours, and I haven't managed to reproduce the above error but nor is there any sign of it terminating!

I'm tempted to suggest we close this as "worksforme" unless we can reproduce the failure; but I can't help wondering how this was initially spotted -- has there been some massive speed regression, so the computation was feasible in Sage as of 7 months back?

I'm pretty sure this issue is now fixed; at least, I've tried running `ModularSymbols(N).cuspidal_submodule().decomposition()` for the first 2000 values of N (and a selection of larger ones), taking several weeks of CPU time, and it's worked fine. The Hecke module decomposition code hasn't changed in any substantial way since the issue was reported, so my guess is that there was a bug in one of the underlying linear-algebra libraries that has now been fixed. 

In an ideal world, we'd have a library of working builds of old Sage versions somewhere and we could try to pinpoint what changed to fix the bug; but since the bug was only ever occurring sporadically, that would be very laborious to do. 

I nominate this ticket to be closed.
