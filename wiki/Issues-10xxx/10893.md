This is Python's old syntax of entering an integer in octal format which has been deprecated.  See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3127/ for more info.

I think this should probably be closed as a non-issue since we don't want to diverge from Python on this point.  Python3 will make this a syntax error even for the `07` case.
