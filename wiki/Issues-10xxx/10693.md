Both of the following work. Both draw an orange 2d point.

```
sage: point((2,3), hue=0.1)
sage: point((2,3), color=hue(0.1))
```

The following work. It draws an orange 3d point.

```
sage: point((2,3,4), color=hue(0.1))
```

The following doesn't work. It draws a 3d point having the default blue color.

```
sage: point((2,3,4), hue=0.1)
```

Note: The actual behavior for 2d point when both color and hue is provided is that hue overwrites color. So the following draws an orange point:

```
sage: point((2,3), color='black', hue=0.1)
```


Component: **graphics**

Keywords: **3d point hue**
