I have created a small patch which allows one to specify the location of twistd's PID file - this is useful when running the notebook as a service (which place their pid files e.g. at /var/run/).

The patch does not change the default behavior (placing it to ${HOME}/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/twistd.pid) and documents the new option.

We never actually used that in sage-on-gentoo but I'll see if I can get it into shape soonish. I have a number of things on my plate and that's not near the top.
