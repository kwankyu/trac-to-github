In plot/plot.py:

```
  sage: p = polar_plot(maple_leaf, -pi/4, 3*pi/2,color="red",plot_points=1000) #long
```
should be tagged "#long time"

This is one of many similar places;  the others are on a separate ticket (#10183).  This ticket should be very easy for a beginner to fix, since all they have to do is change "# long" to "# long time" in one file.

There should be timing tests before and after for testing this file with "sage -t", with and without "-long".

All instances of "#long" should be changed to "# long time". Here is a list of all places that need changing:

```
[mvngu@sage plot]$ pwd
/dev/shm/mvngu/sage-4.6.1.alpha0/devel/sage-main/sage/plot
[mvngu@sage plot]$ grep '#long' plot.py  
            sage: sum([plot(z*sin(x), 0, 10).plot3d(z) for z in range(6)]) #long
            sage: p = polar_plot(maple_leaf, -pi/4, 3*pi/2, color="red",plot_points=1000) #long
            sage: p.show(gridlines=( [-3,-2.75,..,3], xrange(-1,5,2) )) #long
```

This is using Sage 4.6.1.alpha0.

NB I deliberately put just one instance on this ticket and the others at #10183 (at mvngu's suggestion possibly?!) to make this ticket a one-liner for a beginner.

If the newst patch fixes lots more, that's great -- but then #10183 needs changing or even closing too.

(first time reviewer)
I checked the patch using sage-4.6 built from source on Mac OS X 10.6.4). It looks good. I Checked the patched file plot.py, that looks good too. I checked the test times before and after patching:

Before patch:
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py"                     
         [61.5 s]
sage -t --long "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py"               
         [61.9 s]

After patch: 
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py"                     
         [51.2 s]
sage -t --long "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py"               
         [61.7 s]

So the changes had the desired effect, but I'll let someone more experienced look this over and change the ticket status if appropriate.

Sorry for my confusing post above;  it certainly makes sense to fix all three instances in this one file, which is exactly what the third patch does.

I checked that the patch applies cleanly to 4.6.1.alpha0 (it does) and that the before & after timings are similar to those reported by Benjamin.

I did not test any other files;  since no actual code was touched that is not necessary.

Hence a positive review!  I am putting "damek" as author as I don't know his/her real name (it is not at http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac) and Benjamin Jones as reviewer.
