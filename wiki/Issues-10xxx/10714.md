Row vectors from a sparse matrix are incorrect when the matrix has zero rows.

```
sage: D = matrix(0, 2, sparse=False)
sage: D.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: D.nrows()
0
sage: D.rows()
[]
sage: S = matrix(0, 2, sparse=True)
sage: S.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 2 sparse matrices over Integer Ring
sage: S.nrows()
0
sage: S.rows()
[(0, 0)]
```

`sage/matrix/matrix1.Matrix.sparse_rows()` is the place to look.

It seems to me like they are sparse vectors.  

```
sage: S = matrix(0, 2, sparse=True)
sage: v = S.rows()[0]
sage: type(v)

The problem seems to be the `append()` at the outer level in the "finish up" stanza.

Patch just short-circuits when there are no rows and returns an empty list before anything happens to it.  Passes all tests on 4.6.2.alpha2.
