<div id="comment:0"></div>

Right now it cannot be determined:

```
sage: print LatticePolytope([(1,0,0), (-1,0,0)]).origin()
None
```
The attached little patch fixes it:

```
sage: print LatticePolytope([(1,0,0), (-1,0,0)]).origin()
2
```
(2 is the index of the origin in the internal list of 3 lattice points.)
