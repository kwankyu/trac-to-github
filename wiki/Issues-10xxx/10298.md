This ticket contains the overview of the Cluster Algebra and Quiver package. Its aim is to keep track different the different tickets I will open on this topic.

In particular, at the moment, there are changes for

- matrices: (skew-)symmetrizable checks (Ticket #10347), mutations (Ticket #10349)

and the new classes

- `ClusterSeed` (Ticket #13369)

- `Quiver` (Ticket #10538)

- `QuiverMutationType` (Ticket #10527)

Additional tickets/patches

- `Mutation classes` (Ticket #13424) and

- `Mutation type recognition` (Ticket #13425) 

handle more advanced features.

The dependencies are as follows: #10347 < #10349 < #10527 < #10538 < #13369 < #13424 < #13425 .
