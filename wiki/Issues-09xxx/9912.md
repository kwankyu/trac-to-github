<div id="comment:0"></div>

In #7154, the rename_keyword deprecation decorator has an extra argument.  Right now, it's:

```
@rename_keyword(deprecated='Sage 4.6', deprecated_option='thickness', thickness='width') 
```

but should just be

```
@rename_keyword(deprecated='Sage 4.6', thickness='width') 
```

My bad for not catching this in the review stage.

The only one related to this (`DeprecationWarning`) with the *unreleased* 4.6.alpha1.

If you put the deprecation warning into the doctest ("expected"), don't forget to not hard-code the line number (from `ncadoctest.py`!).
