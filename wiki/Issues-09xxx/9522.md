From the end of MPIR's `spkg-install`:

```sh
if [ "$SAGE_CHECK" = "yes" ]; then
    cd ..; ./spkg-check
fi
```
We should remove this, since `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-spkg` already does this check:

```sh
    cd $BASEDIR
    if [ "$SAGE_CHECK" != "" -a -f spkg-check ]; then
        echo "Running the test suite."
        chmod +x spkg-check
        ./spkg-check
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
```

Depends on #8664

There's already [a ticket for updating MPIR to version 2.1.1](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8664) (currently needing review), which apparently is aware of *this* ticket.

I though haven't checked if Mike deleted the superfluous test suite invocation in `spkg-install`.

Done, he *did* remove it. So **this ticket can be closed as duplicate as soon as #8664 gets merged**.

I think there's a good argument for running the mpir test suite every time (i.e. from spkg-install), as it has historically caught several compiler bugs. 

It's obviously pointless running it twice.
