It would be great if we could do

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,3,0]) # curve with CM by Q[I]
sage: (1 + I) * P([1,2])
```
This wouldn't be very hard for CM elliptic curves over QQ, since the necessary functionality is there in PARI's `ellpow`; see #6327. CM elliptic curves over number fields might be a bit harder.

If we can do Q, then we can do number fields simply by adapting the PARI code.  I already have the proof-of-concept code for this.

I have an important mathematical question though: given an elliptic curve E, how can we see whether it has CM and if yes, for which discriminant?

The new code for isogenies should make it easy to implement endomorphisms for CM curves.  Then this sort of thing would be easy.  So I would say that the next step should be to implement endomorphism rings, as structures which know they are rings and also know how to act on points.
