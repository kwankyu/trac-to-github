This is a followup to #8882

In the `__init__` of `CombinatorialFreeModule`, an attribute `_name` is set if it wasn't before. However it can be used during the initialization of Parent by the coercion mechanism leading to some failures. The patch fixes the problem.

Note: the problem was not caught by the current doctests, but became apparent in the upcoming #8881.

Component: **combinatorics**

Keywords: **CombinatorialFreeModule name**
