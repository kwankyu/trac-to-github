This looks like crap:

```
g = graphs.DodecahedralGraph()
g.plot3d(viewer='tachyon')
```
but this looks good:

```
g = graphs.DodecahedralGraph()
show(g.plot3d(engine='tachyon'))
```
Also, this doesn't work (show a plot) at all:

```
g = graphs.DodecahedralGraph()
g.plot3d(engine='tachyon')
```

That's at least 2 bugs / sloppinesses.

I've uploaded the outputs (for me) of the examples.

plot1.png:

```
g = graphs.DodecahedralGraph()
g.plot3d(viewer='tachyon')
```

plot2.png:

```
g = graphs.DodecahedralGraph()
show(g.plot3d(engine='tachyon'))
```

Why is the first plot way worse than the second?
