<div id="comment:0"></div>

Similarly as in #9314

```
sage: latex(-(x+1)/(x+2))
\frac{-x + 1}{x + 2}
```

note the minus sign :(

Also (another report from web):

```
sage: var('a b c x')
sage: solve(a*x^2+b*x+c==0,x)[0]
x == -1/2*(b + sqrt(-4*a*c + b^2))/a
sage: latex(_)
x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{-4 \, a c + b^{2}}}{2 \, a}
```

I fixed this while working on #9394 a while ago. I should have posted a new version of pynac before going on vacation, but couldn't find the time. Hopefully in the next days I'll push my changes to trac for review.
