This will be a straightforward implementation of a direct product of cyclic groups, allowing students to experiment with basic notions of order, cyclicness, subgroups, etc.

Attachment: **[trac_9694-cyclic-group-product-v0.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9694/trac_9694-cyclic-group-product-v0.patch.gz)**

Patch is a rough cut. Requires something in the 4.5.2 alpha/rc series to work.

Posted here because of the hack to avoid having the `__call__` function in the derived class not get called during the initialization.

Somewhere (once per invariant, I think) the creation of the optimized quotient module has a "self()" call that reaches all the way down into this class and if the optimized module is used for conversion, it just causes infinite recursion.  (Also happens with saving _orig_gens but that is more obvious).

Need for the conversion is described more fully at #9695.  Help or advice needed!
