Ratpoints is one of the many standard packages in Sage (see #9281 for a list), which do not have a spkg-check file. This means that if one builds Sage with the environment variable SAGE_CHECK set to "yes", no self-tests of ratpoints will be run. This is silly, as there is a small test suite.

This is not quite as simple as one would like on Solaris, as the test suite makes use of a non-POSIX '-u' option to diff

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/diff.html

so generates this as an output:

```

I emailed this bug report to the developer. I think using 'cmp' rather than 'diff -q' would work fine. Will test it for sure.
