As indicated in #9326, it is desirable for fans and cones associated to toric varieties to know these toric varieties. The framework for such an association was already designed (with a view towards morphisms), this patch puts it to work.

Hi Volker,

This patch should let you to easily add cohomology methods to cones and have everything together in the `toric_variety` module.

I have modified the code of `EnhancedCone` a little with the idea that if you have a chain of enhanced fans

Fan ---> EFan1 ---> EFan2

and, say, intersect two cones belonging to `EFan2`, then three cones will be created replicating the same chain

Cone ---> ECone1 ---> ECone2

I am not completely sure if this is necessary, but it will be consistent in the sense that "base cone" of ECone2 will belong to "base fan" of its fan.

Thank you,
Andrey

The `cone_containing` method of a `Fan_of_toric_variety` should also return a `Cone_of_toric_variety`, but right now:

```
sage: P2=toric_varieties.P2()
sage: fan=P2.fan()
sage: [ type(c) for c in fan ]
[<class 'sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety.Cone_of_toric_variety'>, <class 'sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety.Cone_of_toric_variety'>, <class 'sage.schemes.generic.toric_variety.Cone_of_toric_variety'>]
sage: N=fan.lattice()
sage: c = fan.cone_containing( N(0,1) ); c
1-d cone in 2-d lattice N
sage: type(c)
<class 'sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone'>
sage: c.ambient()
1-d cone in 2-d lattice N
```
