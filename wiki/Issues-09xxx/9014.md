As for linear combinaison, implement a method in misc 'repr_prod' to represent products. 

```
def repr_prodcomb(symbols, coeffs, is_latex=False):
    r"""
    Compute a string representation of a product combination of some
    formal symbols
    """
    bla bla bla

sage: repr_prodcomb(['a','b','c'], [1,-2,-3])
'a * b^-2 * c^-3'
sage: repr_prodcomb([],[])
'1'
```

There is already a such function in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.py

With categories will come FreeGroups(Gens), FreeMonoid(Gens), Free... Such futurs features motivate the need of this function.
