```
sage: A = Matrix(CC,3); A.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: B = A.n(20); B.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Real Field with 20 bits of precision
```

IMHO .n() only should change the precision, no other conversion.

This is also the behaviour of .n() on ComplexField.

The problem being that

```
return self.change_ring(sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealField(prec))
```
doesn't raise an error since it can coerce the motivating matrix to Real. should we avoid coercion, maybe using type checking ?
