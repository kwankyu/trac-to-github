## Tickets to Work On

**[Trac report of id 75 inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/report/75) ([This is the Trac macro *TicketQuery* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (status=needs_review,format=count))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#TicketQuery-macro))** -- most recent first

**[Trac report of id 92 inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/report/92)** -- see which tickets people are currently working on

**[Trac report of id 95 inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/report/95)** --- see larger tasks that require several tickets

**[Trac report of id 63 inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/report/63)** or only **[Trac report of id 74 inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/report/74)**

**[Trac report of id 38 inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/report/38) ([This is the Trac macro *TicketQuery* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (status=new)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#TicketQuery-macro))** -- these are tickets that have been explicitly marked as easier for beginners.

**[Trac report of id 79 inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/report/79) ([This is the Trac macro *TicketQuery* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (status=new)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#TicketQuery-macro))** -- Tickets that silently produce incorrect results

**[Trac report of id 58 inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/report/58)** -- active tickets sorted by modification time, oldest first; many older tickets are likely no longer valid

### Blockers

## Making new reports

While only trac admins are able to create new reports, any user can make a **[custom query](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/query)** and link to it from this page.  If you make something you think will be useful to others, share it here!

If there's a report that you can't make with the custom query functionality, talk to a trac admin or e-mail sage-devel@googlegroups.com.  The database schema is [ here](DBSchema-) if you want to know what kinds of reports are possible.
