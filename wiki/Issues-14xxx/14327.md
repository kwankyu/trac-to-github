<div id="comment:0"></div>

When testing `sage.rings.padics.factory`, a failure in `Qq` is shown in the doctest report as `sage.rings.padics.factory.?` because of the indentation of the following lines.

This is due to a problem in the indentation tracking in `sage.doctest.sources`.

Depends on #12415

Component: **doctest framework**
