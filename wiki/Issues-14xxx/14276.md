From a discussion on [sage-combinat-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/-8d0a3AJYoQ/discussion):

Add a new marker for doctests, `# require failure`, which makes the test fail if the output is the same as the expected output and succeed otherwise.

See also #13278.

Depends on #12281

I have read the thread, but I don't understand the point. What's wrong with

```
sage: 2 + 2   # should be 4 if #56789 is fixed
5
```
or

```
sage: 2 + 2   # known bug: #56789
4
```

And this makes it actually almost useless:

```
Note that requiring failure is not possible if the test raises an exception
```

If we ever implement this, we must allow exceptions as failures.

When the result of the test is more complicated than one number (multiple lines for example), it's easier to delete a `#require failure` comment than fit the correct answer into a comment and then move it once it starts working.  It does seem like a fairly minor benefit though.

I've updated the patch to allow exceptions as failures.
