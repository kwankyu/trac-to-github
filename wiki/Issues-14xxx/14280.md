First of all, it's stuck to 2.0 while upstream is up to something like 2.4 -- though it is explained in SPKG.txt that upgrading to 2.1 was out of the question because it was shockingly slow (sic). I don't know if it's the case and how to check it, so I would like to see that documented more properly.

Second, the spkg has the sources in two directories, src/ and src.del/, which contain mostly the same thing (there's a small diff).

Third, the spkg comes with patches, and those patches do not say whether they have been forwarded upstream, which as far as I know means they didn't.
