If I run the following code in python it works fine

```
import httplib
conn = httplib.HTTPConnection("google.de", 80)
conn.request("GET", "/")
```

But in sage this piece produces an error due to the Sage preparser changing `80` to `Integer(80)`.

Component: **PLEASE CHANGE**

This is not really a bug, although it is annoying. Since I don't see an easy fix, close as invalid?
