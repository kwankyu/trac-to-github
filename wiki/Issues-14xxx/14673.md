The word crystallographic should be spelled with two "l".

The spelling with one "l" is very rare.

For a comparison, try your favorite search engine.

This patch changes all the occurences of 'crystalographic" into "crystallographic"

Hi Frédéric,

While I definitely see this as a worthwhile improvement, one will need to devise a plan for:

- maintaining backward compatibility, with appropriate deprecation, for some time
- making sure that this does not conflict with too many patches outthere

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

Nicolas,

I don't think this will break much, if anything, in the queue. I'll try this out later tonight and can do the review then too.

Best,

Hi Frédéric!

Thanks for fixing this original typo of mine :-)

I went through the patch and am happy with it up to two details:

- Unless I missed it, there lacks a backward compatibility alias for CartanType.samples(crystalographic=True).

- It would be good to add tests for the backward compatibility aliases.
