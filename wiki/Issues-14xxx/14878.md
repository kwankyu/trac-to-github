Pynac-0.7.0 uses Flint to get univariate series expansions. For comparison,

```
                                             now     previously
sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x)))).series(x,8)     50-55µs    13.7s
sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x)))).series(x,12)      69µs      >1min
sin(x*exp(x)).series(x,100)                  3.7ms     11.3s
sin(x*exp(x)).series(x,500)                  215ms       n/a
(sin(x+x^2)*cos(x+x^2)).series(x,1000)       2.86s       n/a
```

Extensive tests are added with #21730 under `tests/`. Pre-Pynac 0.7.0 the tests need 11s vs 0.2s with pynac-0.7.0.

Previous ticket description:

The following

```
f=sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x))))
f.series(x,8)
```
takes something like 30s, which seems a bit too much. Maybe there is some bottleneck somewhere ?
On the other hand, 

```
f.taylor(x,0,8)
```
is faster, but not lightning fast.

In the same spirit, one could try

```
sage: x=PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'x').gen()
sage: sin(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field to Symbolic Ring
```
It would be good if one could apply symbolic functions to power series and get power series when possible.


Depends on #21827

GiNaC's series expansion code seems to be designed for very small orders only. It is incredibly inefficient otherwise:

```
ginsh - GiNaC Interactive Shell (ginac V1.6.2)

Type ?? for a list of help topics.
> time(series(sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x)))), x==0, 8));
2.352s                                                                          
> time(series(sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x)))), x==0, 12));                         
40.104s                                                                         
```

Judging by the number of calls to `gcd`/`lcm` reported by `%prun f.series(x==0, k)` for successive `k`, the number of operations in ℚ seems to grow at least exponentially with `k`, and perhaps like `k!` (while it should be something like `O(k³)` in a naive implementation, and essentially linear in a careful one).

I think that's the heart of the problem, and the difference between the timings with sage and with ginsh is pynac overhead (which should of course be minimized, but only costs a constant factor).
