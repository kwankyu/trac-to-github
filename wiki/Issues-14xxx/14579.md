I got this Traceback with a notebook based on Sage 5.9:

```
G = matrix([[2 for u in (1,..,21)] for v in (1,..,21)])
print G
```

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "_sage_input_47.py", line 10, in <module>
    exec compile(u'open("___code___.py","w").write("# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\n" + _support_.preparse_worksheet_cell(base64.b64decode("RyA9IG1hdHJpeChbWzIgZm9yIHUgaW4gKDEsLi4sMjEpXSBmb3IgdiBpbiAoMSwuLiwyMSldKQpwcmludCBH"),globals())+"\\n"); execfile(os.path.abspath("___code___.py"))

    for frame in inspect.stack():
  File "/waste/cn/sage-5.9/local/lib/python/inspect.py", line 1054, in stack
    return getouterframes(sys._getframe(1), context)
  File "/waste/cn/sage-5.9/local/lib/python/inspect.py", line 1032, in getouterframes
    framelist.append((frame,) + getframeinfo(frame, context))

    if not sourcefile and file[0] + file[-1] != '<>':
IndexError: string index out of range
```

The code works as expected in a Sage shell.
