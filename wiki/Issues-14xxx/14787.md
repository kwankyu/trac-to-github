Hey Ben,

Could you put some line breaks in the bullet point on lines 265, 267? Also could you (and/or coauthors) create more descriptive names for these statistics?

Thanks,

Travis

Hey Jeroen and Ben,

It seems like the pdf builder doesn't include the package(s) to support `\mathscr`, even though the html/mathjax does. Jeroen, could we include `mathrsfs` as part of the pdf build (possibly [also] `amsfonts`), or should we just change this to use `\mathcal` instead?

Thanks,

Travis
