<div id="comment:0"></div>

The current polybori spkg does not install correctly on my system, the config.h header is missing which leads to a compilation error later in sage's build process.

This appears to be caused by my `MAKEOPTS="-j13 -l13"` environment variable. If I unset this variable, config.h installs correctly.

The output with and without that variable set can be found here http://pastebin.com/D2RCadep, notice how the config.h install is missing in the first one.

Upstream: **None of the above - read trac for reasoning.**

Should I report this to the polybori mailing list? This could be a problem in the scons file polybori uses since the spkg-install script passes the MAKEOPTS. I never used scons, so I can't debug this myself.
