And one has already the `is_bipartite` method for quivers, but its code is a bit strange:

```
is_bip = sum( [ innie[i]*outie[i] for i in range(len(innie)) ] ) == 0
```
could be written instead

```
is_bip = not any(innie[i] and outie[i] for i in range(len(innie)))
```

Thanks for the heads up Frederic!  That should make the code vastly easier to write.

I already tested 

```
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(['A',4])
sage: Q2 = ClusterQuiver(['A',3])

sage: dg = Q.digraph();
sage: dg2 = Q2.digraph();

sage: dgnew = cartesian_product([dg,dg2]); dgnew.show()

sage: dgnew2 = dg.strong_product(dg2); dgnew2.show()
```

regarding tensor and triangle products.

Gregg

Dear Frederic,

I just made this change from Sage Days 54 as an example using the new GIT workflow.

I will get to the other changes regarding square, triangle, etc. product later on.
