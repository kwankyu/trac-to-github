Finite enumerated sets require that their `list` methods and `iter` methods return elements in the same order.  This is tested in `sage.categories.enumerated_sets.EnumeratedSets.ParentMethods._test_enumerated_set_iter_list`, but the test is not run if the number of elements is larger than a bound.  #14284 changed that bound from 100 to 729, revealing the following bug:

```
sage: G = GL(2, 5)
sage: TestSuite(G).run() # G.max_test_enumerated_set_loop = 500; TestSuite(G).run() # before :trac:`14284`
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: [2 0]
[0 1] != [0 1]
[1 0]
```

Depends on #14284

It is not clear because `GL(2,5)` is no longer in the category of (finite) enumerated sets.
