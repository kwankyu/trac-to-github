When the user does

```
./sage -i graphviz
```
there is no obvious clue that an experimental package is being installed.

With the patch, when downloading an experimental package, there is a warning:

```
jdemeyer@boxen:/release/merger/sage-5.9.beta3$ ./sage -i graphviz
Attempting to download package graphviz
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
[.]
>>> Checking online list of experimental packages.
[.]
>>> Found graphviz-2.16.1.p0

WARNING: you are about to download and install an experimental package.
This probably won't work at all for you! There is no guarantee that it
has ever been built correctly! Use at your own risk!
Are you sure you want to continue [Y/n]?
```

Something analogous happens for archive packages.

**Apply** [attachment:14398_warn_experimental.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket14398/14398_warn_experimental.patch) to `SAGE_ROOT`.

Exactly.

The problem is apparently simple lack of dependencies (pango and libperl-dev, perhaps).  See #11433 and #4864.  I suppose this is a duplicate of #7438, in some sense.

Why should we keep this if nobody can install it ? The problem could even be solved if there was on some page of the manual some instructions saying that we do not know how to fix this bug (it's not our fault after all) but that one library should be installed manually ?

But then again the bug you get is even different from mine `-_-`

Honestly, why do we care ? It's not "experimental", it's just plain broken.

See #7438; it builds fine on boxen.math.  Let's continue the discussion about graphviz there.  

If you want to open a sage-devel discussion about how non-broken experimental packages should be, that's fine.  In my view - and as you know, I am pretty conservative on such things - experimental can be as broken as they want to be.  *Someone* probably does have the expertise to fix each of them, and removing them completely means no one will even have the chance.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A8):
> experimental can be as broken as they want to be.  *Someone* probably does have the expertise to fix each of them, and removing them completely means no one will even have the chance.

I agree with this. There is a reason we differentiate between *optional* and *experimental*.

However, there is one thing that could be improved: when the user does

```
./sage -i graphviz
```
there is no obvious clue that an experimental package is being installed.

So, we could make it so that downloading an experimental package this way would first print a warning along the lines of

```
WARNING: you are about to download and install an experimental package. This
probably won't work at all for you! Use at your own risk!
Are you sure you want to continue [Y/n]?
```

+1 ! 

But I still think that "experimental" should mean "we don't know if the code runs everywhere, we just want to give it a 'real-life' try before making it optional or standard". Not "it does not work, everybody forgot about it, and 'experimental' is our spkg garbage folder".

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A10):

I think that's more or less what I understand as the definition of "optional" packages.

I don't think we need another category of packages (standard, optional, experimental, garbage, archive).

Many optional packages are optional because they are not gpl-compatible, or because they are too heavy to be standard. I don't get why a spkg would be optional otherwise... Either way, there is "experiment" in "experimental". That's actually the largest part of it. I stand by the rather bold claim that experimental packages should consist in... an experiment. And I don't see what could make this graphviz spkg an experiment.
