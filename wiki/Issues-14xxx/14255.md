Hey Christian,

Looks good but there's two minor docstring things. First is I don't understand this line 210 in `unbounded_map()`:

```
This can then be used to be applied to an element.
```
Second (and more nitpicky and far less important), the first line is suppose to be in the "affirmative" according to python doc standards:

```
Return the unbounded..."
```

Thanks,

Travis

means that this is now an unbounded function and it takes one input parameter, namely `self`. How do you think I should write that?

alright, I will do that... (but first waiting for your answer to the above).

How does this sound:

```
You can use this method to return a function which takes as input an
element in the domain of the combinatorial map. See the example below.
```
? Also could you put another blank line between this and the "Return" line? Thank you.
