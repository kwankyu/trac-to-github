```
The absolute_ideal method uses 'a' as the name of the generator of the absolute_field, which may conflict with a user-chosen generator for the absolute_field (if that has already been done) or with some other variable that's in use.

This small fix adds an optional "names" argument so that a user can force agreement between the absolute_ideal and absolute_field if it was already constructed.  If no name is passed, the default 'a' is used.

Most recent change to the patch adds a doctest for the optional names argument.

**Assignee:** @loefflerd

**Keywords:** absolute ideal, absolute field

**Reviewer:** Alina Bucur

**Author:** David Lukas, Michelle Manes

**Merged:** sage-5.12.beta3
