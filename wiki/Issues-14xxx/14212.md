The absolute_ideal method uses 'a' as the name of the generator of the absolute_field, which may conflict with a user-chosen generator for the absolute_field (if that has already been done) or with some other variable that's in use.

This small fix adds an optional "names" argument so that a user can force agreement between the absolute_ideal and absolute_field if it was already constructed.  If no name is passed, the default 'a' is used.

Most recent change to the patch adds a doctest for the optional names argument.

Component: **number fields**

Keywords: **absolute ideal, absolute field**

Author: **David Lukas, Michelle Manes**

Reviewer: **Alina Bucur**

Merged: **sage-5.12.beta3**
