#9128 enabled links to the reference manual from other documents like the thematic tutorials. 
This import feature is currently broken. Until this is fixed, the updated thematic tutorial index from #14090 will look lame.

The issue to be due to a wrong initialization order for the sphinx app. At least the attached patch, which I am using for now for the Sage-Combinat tutorials, seems to work around it. Probably the sphinx internals were change in the mean time. #13057 may have had an influence too.

Note: I am not suggesting to merge or review the currently attached patch. It's just there to point where the problem seem to be.

This seems to be fixed now. See e.g. the crosslink "Introduction to combinatorics in Sage" which points to the reference manual in:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html

I thus mark this ticket as duplicate. If anyone has an idea of when this was fixed, it would be good to add a ref.
