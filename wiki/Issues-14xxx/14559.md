To change the Sage banner, you need to modify the file `devel/sage/sage/misc/banner.py`. The file `local/bin/sage-banner` is auto-generated from that file.

It should definitely be configurable! But I guess a user do not want to hack the source at each version. There might be a function in "$HOME/.sage/init.sage" or "$HOME/.sage/custom_banner" succeptible of doing the job (to whom we send the version, the release date, etc).

Maybe we should introduce half a dozen new environment variables to control this. Right, Leif? ;)

More seriously, I'm happy with the current patch. Do we want to get that merged soon and deal with further customization on another ticket, or deal with everything here?
