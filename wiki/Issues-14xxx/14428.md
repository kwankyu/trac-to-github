<div id="comment:0"></div>

Currently the sage objects created by 

```
sage: t = Tachyon() 
```
only accept certain drawn primitives that are predefined inside **sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.py** after they are created, e.g. using sphere, plane, cylinder methods to insert those figures. General sage 3d plots can't be added to such scenes. A round about method using 

```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: a = plot3d(sin(x+y), (x, -4, 4), (y, -4, 4))
sage: tachyon_rt(a.tachyon())
```

is possible, however most of the options are hard-coded into **sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx**. Even worse the whole scene is treated as one large text file making any further manipulation difficult at best.

I've cleaned up and attached some function definitions that outline the approach I had in mind.  Part of it is similar to the approach of anton_t, but it also includes some code for extracting a tachyon scene string from a graphics object and some code for joining the objects from a scene string into another Tachyon object.

It's still in a very sketchy state, and I'm not yet sure this is the best approach, but it's what I have at the moment :)
