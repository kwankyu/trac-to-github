Currently, `lift_to_key()` is not implemented exactly as described in MacLane's article. Implementing it exactly as stated might be beneficial, see https://github.com/MCLF/henselization/issues/44#issuecomment-1056062545.

We could expose the original description of the algorithm with an `algorithm="maclane"` flag and see whether it performs better than the current implementation, e.g., because it might result in smaller coefficients and therefore might turn out to be more efficient.
