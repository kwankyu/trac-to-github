This in particular is observed on Debian 11, see

The latter is an extract from a failing doctest.

While it's fixed in fplll's master, we need a fix for the current fpylll.

Thanks. On Debian 11 BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY is not full path, it's just `default.json`. So the path has to be prepended.
In some other cases it's full path, so either nothing should be prepended, or it can be done as in the patch.
