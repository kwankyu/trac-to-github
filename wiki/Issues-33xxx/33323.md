This should work (as long as it accepts negative values, which there is nothing wrong with it, it is just an empty set), but it results in an overflow error:

```
sage: Partitions(-5)
Partitions of the integer -5
sage: _.cardinality()
```

That is for the default using `flint`, but `gap` is wrong:

```
sage: Pm5.cardinality(algorithm='gap')
1
sage: Pm5.cardinality(algorithm='pari')
0
```
This is needed for doctests on #30680.

I would rather think that most combinatorial objects return a `ValueError`:
see `DyckWords(-2)`, `BinaryTrees(-2)`, `Posets(-2)`,  `Tableaux(-2)` and `TamariIntervalPosets(-2)`.

`AlternatingSignMatrices(-2)` returns an `ArithmeticError`.

But `Compositions(-2)`, `SuperPartitions(-2)` and `Permutations(-2)`"work".

If you prefer, returning the empty set would be another solution. Do we have such an object ?

Perhaps it would be better for these to raise a `ValueError` to be consistent with other objects. However, we would also need to make sure that this continues to work:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: list(s.basis(-2))

We do not seem to have a singular `EmptySet` object, just `EmptySetError`.

sage: for a in P: print(a)
sage:

I'm somewhat agnostic about whether `Partitions(-3)` should raise an error or return an empty set. It feels somewhat different in flavor than `Posets(-3)` because it doesn't make sense to ask for a poset with `-3` elements, while you could ask for all partitions of the number `-3` — there just aren't any.
