Since Docker Hub made `hooks/` a premium feature, our README does not get updated automatically from the one in our repository anymore.

Unfortunately, we can only have very few accounts on Docker Hub that have access to the sagemath organization. (More would also be a premium feature.)

So, currently the README can only be updated manually by the few who have access there.
