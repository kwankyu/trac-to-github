Maybe one should not remove the maxima algorithm, which is not using the pexpect interface in fact ?

I agree that it would be better not to remove the `algorithm="maxima"` option without deprecating it first.

As far as I understand, the native Sage implementation of the Stirling numbers of the second kind and the Sage implementation were both written by Fredrik. Is the native Sage version better in some way? Do we need to keep it at all?

Would it make sense to change the default implementation for some of the functions?

A minor style point: why do you write

```
def stirling_number1(n, k, algorithm=None) -> Integer:
    ...
    if algorithm is None:
        algorithm='gap'
```
rather than

```
def stirling_number1(n, k, algorithm="gap") -> Integer:
    ...
```
?
