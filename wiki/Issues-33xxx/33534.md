... in src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx (`_save_image_png`)

From https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido#background:

  programmatically generating [...] PNGs [...] from web-based visualization libraries (e.g. Plotly.js, Vega-Lite, etc.) is a complex problem. [...] The core difficulty is that web-based visualization libraries don't actually render plots (i.e. color the pixels) on their own, instead they [...] rely on a web browser rendering engine to display figures.

  When the figure is displayed in a browser window, it's relatively straight-forward [...] to provide an export-image button because it has full access to the browser for rendering. [...] to export an image programmatically (e.g. from Python) without displaying it in a browser and without user interaction [...], the Python portion of the visualization library needs programmatic access to a web browser's rendering engine.

There are at least two options:

- https://pypi.org/project/kaleido/ (related to plot.js)

  provides prebuilt pip-installable wheels containing a chromium build

- https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer (#33533):

   When you run pyppeteer for the first time, it downloads the latest version of Chromium (~150MB) if it is not found on your system. If you don't prefer this behavior, ensure that a suitable Chrome binary is installed. One way to do this is to run `pyppeteer-install` command before prior to using this library.
