Running 

```
docker pull ghcr.io/sagemath/sage/sage-docker-ubuntu-focal-standard-with-targets:latest
```

or 

```
docker pull ghcr.io/sagemath/sage/sage-docker-ubuntu-focal-standard-with-targets
```

results in `manifest unknown` error. It only works if one specifies a version, e.g. `9.5` in place of `latest`.
