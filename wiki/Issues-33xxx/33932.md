Documentation says "Sets with unhashable objects work, but with less functionality". However, this functionality is actually broken in at least two ways.

First, Sets of unhashable elements fail to recognize equal elements - for example

```
S = Set([factor(10),factor(10)])
print(S)
```

prints `Set of elements of [2 * 5, 2 * 5]`, that is the resulting Set here contains two identical elements.

---

Second, Set skips the first element when it's created from an iterator of unhashable elements:

```
S = Set( [i] for i in (1..5) )
print(list(S))
```

This code prints `[[2], [3], [4], [5]]`, that is the first generated element `[1]` is missing.

A patch for the latter issue was proposed at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/62252/?answer=62285#post-id-62285 which however comes with an overhead.
