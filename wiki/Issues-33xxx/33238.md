Comments welcome!  In particular, it would be wonderful to find more interesting applications.  

In short: given two finite sets `A` and `B`, a statistic `tau: B -> Z`, and a set partition `P` of `A`, the program finds all possible statistics `s: A -> Z` which have the same distribution as `tau` but are constant on the blocks of `P`.

There is still some ongoing work. In particular, we try to implement a cache of solutions, which is checked for counterexamples before asking the solver to produce a counterexample from scratch.

I have found the culprit already - `deepcopy` takes forever:

```
sage: %prun next(bij.solutions_iterator())
         54830 function calls (54618 primitive calls) in 25.558 seconds

   Ordered by: internal time

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1   24.908   24.908   24.908   24.908 {method '__deepcopy__' of 'sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram' objects}
   ...
```
vs.

A question about the general design: currently there is a helper class `_BijectionistMILP`.  I am not quite sure whether it might be better to merge it into the main class or not.

The idea in creating it was to separate the MILP from the user interface.  More precisely, the methods `Bijectionist.set_*` in the main class are responsible to normalizing and organizing the input, whereas the methods `_BijectionistMILP.add_*_constraint` in the helper class actually turn the input into constraints.

Also, the helper class organizes a cache of solutions, and, whenever a new solution is found, a veto constraint is added to the MILP.  Put differently, the set of solutions in the cache together with the set of solutions in the MILP is always constant.

I think the current solution is OK, but I am open to improvements.

Possibly, using the `indices` argument of `new_variable`, I could slightly simplify parts of the code.  Currently, variables are added as needed, and blocks where this is not allowed are guarded by checking whether the number of variables changed.

I am not sure how easy it is to determine the allowed indices - they are a subset of `P x Z`, where `P` is the set of constant blocks and `Z` is the set of values.

It may help to think about the overall structure of the code by considering whether 1. other enumeration technologies could be supported, or 2. whether some of your code could be generalized. 

1. Alternative techniques for the 0/1 enumeration: lattice point enumeration (`Polyhedron.integral_points()`), SAT (e.g. #33461 cvc5). 

2. Here you enumerate 0/1 solutions by repeatedly solving a MIP with no-good cuts added.

If you generalize the form of your cuts a bit (so that their validity does not depend on equal cardinality), then you'd have a general algorithm for enumeration that could take as input any 0/1 IP -- which could be a useful addition to the Sage library. (It could later be improved by solver-specific techniques such as accessing the solver's solution pools, or using solver callbacks.)

Could you please expand?  I do not really understand what you mean.  In particular, I do not know what a cut is, and what you mean with "equal cardinality".  Is the idea that to have a class that gets you all solutions for a MIP, instead of just one?

I admit that I am slightly afraid of increasing the scope of the project at this stage.  Did you have a look at the MILPs solved?  (some are documented in `solutions_iterator`, there are some more in `_forced_constant_blocks`, `minimal_subdistributions_iterator` and `minimal_subdistributions_block_iterator`)

Please excuse, I have yet another question.  I was trying to simplify `evaluate_linear_function`, is there code to check whether a given set of values satisfies a constraint?

Besides, I asked chatGPT.  It answered as follows:

--- begin quote ---

Yes, you can use the MILP class from the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` module in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) to check whether a given set of values satisfies a constraint of a MILP.

Here is an example of how you can use the MILP class to check whether a given set of values satisfies a constraint of a MILP:

```
from sage.numerical.mip import MixedIntegerLinearProgram

# Create a new MILP
milp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()

# Set up variables
x = milp.new_variable(real=True, nonnegative=True)
y = milp.new_variable(real=True, nonnegative=True)

# Set up constraints
milp.add_constraint(x + y <= 1)
milp.add_constraint(x - y >= 0)

# Check whether the given set of values satisfies the constraints
satisfies_constraints = milp.check_feasibility([x: 0.5, y: 0.5])

print(satisfies_constraints)  # prints True
```

Could you show me the definition of check_feasibility?

Certainly! Here is the definition of the `check_feasibility` method of the MILP class from the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` module in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath):

```
def check_feasibility(self, values=None, variable_order=None, solver=None):
    """
    Check the feasibility of a given set of values.
    
    INPUT:
    
    - ``values`` -- a dictionary of variable names to values.
    
    - ``variable_order`` -- a list of variable names in the order in which they
      should be presented to the solver. If not specified, the default
      order is used.
    
    - ``solver`` -- the name of the solver to use. If not specified, the
      default solver is used.
    
    OUTPUT:
    
    Returns True if the given set of values satisfies all of the constraints
    of the MILP, and False otherwise.
    
    EXAMPLES:
    
    Check the feasibility of a given set of values::
    
        sage: from sage.numerical.mip import MixedIntegerLinearProgram
        sage: milp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
        sage: x = milp.new_variable(real=True, nonnegative=True)
        sage: y = milp.new_variable(real=True, nonnegative=True)
        sage: milp.add_constraint(x + y <= 1)
        sage: milp.add_constraint(x - y >= 0)
        sage: milp.check_feasibility([x: 0.5, y: 0.5])
        True
    
    """
    # ...
```

Unfortunately, this method does not exist in the current sagemath develop branch :-(

Sorry for the jargon. "Cut" is short for "inequality". What you call a "veto inequality" is commonly called a "no-good cut". 

When you have a solution x1=1, x2=1, x3=0, x4=0,
you are generating an inequality x1+x2 <= 1 in order to cut off this solution, but 
this is only valid because you know that x1+x2+x3+x4 = 2.
The more general form of the no-good cut would be (1-x1)+(1-x2)+x3+x4 >= 1, which is linearly equivalent to your inequality given x1+x2+x3+x4 = 2.

Is it really the case that `LinearConstraint` does not know its variables, other than by integer index, and that, given an index, there is no way to obtain the key?

Explicitly:

```
sage: m = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = m.new_variable(indices=["a", "b", "c"])
sage: c = x["a"] + 2*x["b"] >= 3
sage: low, f = next(c.inequalities())
sage: x.items()
dict_items([('a', x_0), ('b', x_1), ('c', x_2)])
sage: f.dict()
{0: 1.0, 1: 2.0}
```
What I'd like to do is to "evaluate" `f`, and I think that this should be a method in `LinearConstraint`, possibly it should be the `subs` method, but I am unsure, because I'd like it to return `True` or `False` if the constraint is satisfied by the given values.

Some more comments on this:
- the steps of `_initialize_new_bmilp` could be merged into `_BijectionistMILP.__init__`
- `_show_bmilp` would make more sense as a method of `_BijectionistMILP` (it breaks the abstraction of `_BijectionistMILP`)
- also `_solution` could be changed to a (public) method of `_BijectionistMILP`; and perhaps there could be a slightly more high-level function so that various Bijectionist methods do not have to repeat the "try ... solve ... except MIPSolverException ... else solution" pattern

The default implementation of `integral_points` is not very good for this use case.
But after `sage -i pynormaliz`, you can do 

```
sage: bmilp = bij._initialize_new_bmilp()
sage: %time p = bmilp.milp.polyhedron(base_ring=QQ, backend='normaliz')
CPU times: user 110 ms, sys: 3.31 ms, total: 113 ms
Wall time: 112 ms
sage: %time p = bmilp.milp.polyhedron(base_ring=QQ, backend='normaliz').integral_points()
CPU times: user 317 ms, sys: 35.3 ms, total: 352 ms
Wall time: 380 ms
```
In this example (perfect formulation), it only adds overhead.

It would be interesting to investigate bijectionist examples in which the IP solver actually has to do something nontrivial.

I have now completed most of your suggestions.  The remaining ones are:

* perhaps there could be a slightly more high-level function [replacing `_BijectionistMILP.solution`] so that various Bijectionist methods do not have to repeat the `try ... solve ... except MIPSolverException ... else solution` pattern 

* I would also suggest to introduce a method in `_BijectionistMILP` that returns the variable `_x[p, z]` so that you can remove the direct use of this attribute from the Bijectionist class.

I am not completely sure how exactly I should go about these.  I am still not convinced that it is a good idea to have the helper class at all.  The distinction between "temporary constraints", which are built in the main class and passed to `_BijectionistMILP.solve` and "permanent constraints", which are built by `_BijectionistMILP` itself, doesn't look completely right to me.

Also, it seems a bit strange that `_BijectionistMILP` calls methods of the main class, `_preprocess_intertwining_relations` and `_compute_possible_block_values`.  Maybe these should be moved to the helper class also?  

On a quite different level, I am pretty sure that the logic of `_forced_constant_blocks` can be simplified.  Apart from the main routine, note that at the very end we do `self.set_constant_blocks`, which invalidates the MILP and therefore all solutions in the cache.

Yet another thing, which is truly a detail: the method `_is_solution` really should be a method of `LinearConstraint`.

In summary, there is still a lot of work that could be done, but I am not sure whether the right time for this is now.

Instead of `type(...) is list`, you can use `isinstance(..., collections.abc.Iterable)` - https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes

Also after each the `elif` blocks, there should probably be an `else` block that raises an error.
