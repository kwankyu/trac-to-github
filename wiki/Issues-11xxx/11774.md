```
The Singular start-up scripts (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/[Ss]ingular`) created by Sage currently look like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
Singular-3-1-1 $*
```
The `$*` has to be changed to `"$@"` (including the quotes), to allow spaces within parameters.

They are created by Singular's `spkg-install` (in `create_singular_script()`), so *the spkg* has to be changed.
