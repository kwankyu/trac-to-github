`AbstractLinearCode`s inherits `addition_table()` (and possibly other methods) which do not even work for the object:

```
sage: C = codes.random_linear_code(GF(2), 10, 3)
sage: C.addition_table()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'LinearCode' object has no attribute 'group'
```
