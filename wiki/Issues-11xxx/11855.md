The return value of the existing function is a fraction field element, not a power series.

```
sage: I.hilbert_series()
(-t - 1)/(t - 1)
sage: type(I.hilbert_series())
<type 'sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement'>

Singular cannot represent power series in its interpreter, but we can. :)

The patch adds a second hilbert_series function instead of the changing the one that exists already. Also, the old one has some advantages over this new one: `@`require field, more extensive docs, test whether the ideal is homogeneous.

Clearly it is a bad idea to implement another hilbert_series method from scratch. Obviously, if one wants hilber_series to return a power series, then one should modify the existing hilbert_serie method.\n\nMoreover, I think we don't want it to return a power series. Isn't a power series in Sage an object with a finite precision? Hence, while a quotient (i.e., fraction field element) of two polynomials generates *all* (infinitely many) terms of the Hilbert series, a power series can only provide finitely many terms, isn't it?\n\nSo, I am against that change. I could only imagine that one has an optional parameter \"as_power_series\" (default False). Then, `I.hilber_series()` would return the *full* Hilbert series (namely as a quotient of two polynomials), while `I.hilbert_series(as_power_series=True)` would return a (truncated) power series.",
