First session:

```
sage: P.<foo,bar> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: save(P,'tmp')
```

Second session:

```
sage: Q = load('tmp.sobj')
sage: P.<foo,bar> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: Q is P
False
sage: Q2 = load('tmp.sobj')
sage: Q2 is P
True
sage: Q2 is Q
False
```

That is fixed with the attached patch.
