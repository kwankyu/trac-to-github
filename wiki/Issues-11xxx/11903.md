Apparently fast_callable doesn't know that there is a C log function, for some reason:

```
sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.7.2.alpha3, Release Date: 2011-09-28'
sage: f(x)=log(x)
sage: g=fast_callable(f,vars=[x],domain=float)
sage: g.python_calls()
[log]
```
 
A quick glance at the source code indicates that the log function should be translated to the C equivalent.  So maybe it's an issue with not recognizing the log for some reason.
