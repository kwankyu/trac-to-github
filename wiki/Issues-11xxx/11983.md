<div id="comment:0"></div>

We have

```
sage: F.<a>=GF(9)
sage: R.<x,y>=F[]
sage: a*x+1
(a)*x + 1
```
There, clearly the parentheses around `a` are unnecessary. In the univariate case, the phenomenon does not appear:

```
sage: S.<s>=F[]
sage: a*s+1
a*s + 1
```

The reason is that this should return True:

```
sage: F._repr_option('element_is_atomic')
False
```

Component: **user interface**

Keywords: **parentheses, multivariate polynomial, finite field**
