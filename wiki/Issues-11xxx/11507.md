Currently this makes a vector over callable symbolic expressions: `f(x,y,z)=(x<sup>2,y</sup>2,x*z*y)`.  But this doesn't work: `f(x,y,z)=vector([x<sup>2,y</sup>2,x*z*y])`.  This means that it's painful to do calculations on symbolic vectors and easily make new vector valued functions.

How does this relate to #11180?

They are related, but different, I think.  #11180 is about allow the `f` in the description to take a vector as an input; this one is about *creating* a new function using a vector.  Best to keep them separate.
