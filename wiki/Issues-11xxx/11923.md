<div id="comment:0"></div>

When showing graphs in 3d, the argument pos3d is received by show3d but not passed to plot3d.

Eg.

```
sage: G=graphs.PathGraph(20)
sage: p=dict([(v,(v*(1 if v%3==0 else 0), v*(1 if v%3==1 else 0), v*(1 if v%3==2 else 0))) for v in G ])
sage: G.plot3d(pos3d=p)
sage: G.show3d(pos3d=p)
```
