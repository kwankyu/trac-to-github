I suspect this is a regression, but I do not have and old sage copy right now

```
sage: K=QQ[I]['x,t']
sage: K.inject_variables()
Defining x, t
sage: f=t^2+1
sage: f.factor()
(t + (-I)) * (t + (I))
sage: K=QQ[sqrt(5),I]['t']  
sage: K.inject_variables()
Defining t
sage: f=t^2+1   
sage: f.factor()
(x + I) * (x - I)
sage: prod(f.factor())==f
False
sage: f.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5 over its base field
sage: prod(f.factor()).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5 over its base field
```

Factor of uni-variate polynomials in polynomial rings (uni and multivariate) over towers of number fields are broken, since the output variable is always 'x', so it the output is in the wrong ring.

**Keywords:** factorization, tower of number fields

The problem has been solved. It was an easy mistake in the code. The doctest shows that the problem has disapeared and the documentation looks god.

Buildbot says that doctest pass.

Positive review.
