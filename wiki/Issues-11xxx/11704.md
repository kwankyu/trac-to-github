Similarly to `SAGE_ROOT`, it might be good to resolve symbolic links in `$HOME/.sage` when assigning `DOT_SAGE`.  This can be useful for example when `$HOME/.sage` is a symbolic link to a non-existent directory (the directory would be created later in `sage-sage`).

Probably we should use whatever solution comes from #5852.

Depends on #11924

It's precisely for the reason I said: we need to be able to determine a usable value of `$SAGE_ROOT` before we can do *anything* with Sage.

It's true that it doesn't matter that it's canonical, but we still need to dereference symbolic links in `$0` (the script filename) to find `$SAGE_ROOT`.  Since #5852, we support an installation where somebody makes a symbolic link from `/usr/local/bin/sage` to `/usr/local/sage/sage-4.8/sage` or whatever.

I agree the code duplication is not so nice, but I still think the patch can be reviewed as-is.
