```sh
$ host irc.freenode.net
irc.freenode.net is an alias for chat.freenode.net.
chat.freenode.net has address 174.143.119.91
chat.freenode.net has address 78.40.125.4
chat.freenode.net has address 213.92.8.4
chat.freenode.net has address 38.229.70.20
chat.freenode.net has address 213.179.58.83
...
```

That's (currently) true, but IRC is not only the traditional name, but also a well defined term (or protocol), while "chat" can refer to almost everything, so `irc.freenode.net` is much less ambiguous.
