Using the following piece of code makes the memory footprint of sage 
 grow indefinitely:

```
sage: K = GF(1<<50,'t') 
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(K)
sage: a = K.random_element()
sage: while 1: 
....:      R(a)
....:
```

The memleak happens when different si2sa_* functions are called.

See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/9a8e887df34a8e9a for further discussion.

I just retested it and it seems to fix the memleak for me:

no increase in memory footprint after 30 minutes.

Which code did you run ?

The one in the tickect description or the one on sage-support post ?

Because there are other memleaks involved when using EllipticCurve class.

See #11495 and #11521 for example.

I must have forgotten to do 'sage -b' when I tried before.  Apologies
for the noise.

This time when I applied the patch (and did 'sage -b') the code in the
ticket description ran for 30 CPU minutes without an increase in memory.
I also did 'make testlong' and all tests passed.

Positive review!
