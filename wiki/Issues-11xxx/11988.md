```
sage: G = DirichletGroup(1234)
sage: latex(G.0)
Dirichlet character modulo 1234 of conductor 617 mapping $3 \mapsto \zeta_{616}$
```
When using the notebook, this will display the entire text in mathmode and add some dollar signs to it.

I don't think this is a very good solution: `_latex_` methods should return a string which renders the description nicely in LaTeX math mode.

Calling `latex` to wrap a string into verb environment and inserting explicit phantoms for space making purposes is not very aesthetically pleasing - the general framework does it because it seems to be the only option that works OK for general and unknown strings which may include special characters and be designed to be aligned.

Here I would suggest to use `\hbox` around the text that you want to see as text (hbox does work with jsmath, unlike other usual alternatives). This should take care of spaces as well, or you case use `\ ` etc.

I also think that it is MUCH better when the output in the doctest is complete, not just some selected piece of it. This allows to detect changes/regressions in the future.

Looks and works good!

Although you may want to consider

```
r'\hbox{Dirichlet character modulo } %s \hbox{ of conductor } %s \hbox{ mapping } %s' \
    %  (self.modulus(), self.conductor(), mapst)
```
so that all numbers are typeset in math mode, otherwise they look a bit different.
