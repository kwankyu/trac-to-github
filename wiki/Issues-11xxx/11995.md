Upstream PARI has extended the `Vec()`, `Vecrev()`,  `Vecsmall()`, `Col()` functions to allow an optional argument giving a minimum length.  The PARI currently in Sage does not support this, but we can easily emulate it in the Sage library.

Also, to minimize surprises, we should implement `Vecrev()` using the PARI library function, instead of having our own `Vecrev()`.  For most Sage applications, `.list()` should be used anyway instead of `.Vecrev()`.

For completeness, we add a `Colrev()` method which does not exist in PARI.
