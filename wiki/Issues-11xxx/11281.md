.. math:: environments seem to be ignored in the live documentation. See e.g. the second method `random_element` in http://localhost:8080/doc/live/reference/quat_algebras/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.html (with the notebook running on your machine).

The inline math environments work fine. The same .. math environment work fine in the static documentation
