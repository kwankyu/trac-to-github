Unless special libraries or C flags are needed, we can auto-generate almost this whole list, which simplifies the making of new .pyx files in the standard library.

I am sure this needs rebasing WRT any new modules that have been added.

Not surprising (see ticket description), the patches need to be rebased.

The merged Cygwin patch involved many changes to `module_list.py`, too.

Btw, IMHO `libcsage` and `libstdcxx` should **not** be "linked" unconditionally (especially regardless of the module's `language`) to each and every module.
(I recently started sorting out which modules really directly use `libcsage`, and did add `"stdcxx"` to `libraries` only if `language=="c++"`. Currently suspended work in progress...)

For sure, but I figured it'd be better to refractor and clean things up in separate steps (in case one or the other has unintended consequences). 

For the record, I plan to add this functionality to Cython soon (including transitivity of library dependance), so that may make this patch invalid. Sorting what modules actually need what will be very useful though.

I just wanted to decrease the number of tickets needing review. ;-)
