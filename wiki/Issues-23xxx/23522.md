# Issue 23522: Improve TestSuite coverage

    "body": "Currently, the test suite does not run for many parents when it comes, e.g., to matrices or polynomial rings. It would be good to add methods such as `_test_matrix_space()` and `_test_polynomial_ring()` to rings so that they run the test suite automatically for some matrix spaces and polynomial created from that ring. (Of course, one has to take care that this does not get too recursive\u2026)\n\n**CC:**  @roed314\n\nIssue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23522\n\n",
