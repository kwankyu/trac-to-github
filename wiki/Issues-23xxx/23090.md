OK ! 

the problem was using `align` environment which i've changed to `aligned` (the former works in the html doc, but not in the latex to pdf, some examples in [the Guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#latex-typesetting)) 

Ralf, i'm setting back to positive on your behalf. 

```
$ ./sage --docbuild reference pdf
...
[website  ] build succeeded.
Build finished.  The built documents can be found in /Users/forets/sage-src/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website


PDF documents have been created in subdirectories of

  /Users/forets/sage-src/sage/local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference

Alternatively, you can open

  /Users/forets/sage-src/sage/local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/index.html

for a webpage listing all of the documents.
