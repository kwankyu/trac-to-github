Currently sage uses brute force or enumeration to find rational points for schemes. This algorithm finds solutions up to a given height bound for a scheme X much more efficiently. The algorithm begins by finding solutions mod a set of primes based off the given height bound and then lifts with Chinese Remainder Theorem. Then it applies the LLL algorithm to find the smallest height point that satisfied the mod p condition. The algorithm stores these points, checks them as solutions and returns a list of the points.
