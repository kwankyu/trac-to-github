A coercion of polynomial rings that is induced by a morphism on the base rings is injective/surjective iff the underlying morphism is. However this is currently not the case:

```
sage: QQ['x'].coerce_map_from(ZZ['x']).is_injective()
NotImplementedError
sage: GF(2)['x'].coerce_map_from(ZZ['x']).is_surjective()
NotImplementedError
```
