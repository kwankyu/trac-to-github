Comparison of manifold points, as implemented in `ManifoldPoint.__eq__`, relies on comparison of coordinate values in a common chart. When coordinates are symbolic, this goes through Maxima and can take a lot of time. Now, comparison of points is involved in the unique representation of tangent spaces. When many tangent spaces are created (as for instance when plotting a vector field), this has a non-neglible cost. This ticket makes `ManifoldPoint.__eq__` faster by invoking `(a-b).is_trivial_zero()` when `a` and `b` are symbolic coordinates of two points, while the previous version was using `a == b`. Note that for non-symbolic values (i.e. numerical values), `a == b` is still used.

The only other comment that I have is that you have three nested if statements, e.g.

```python
if isinstance(diff_c, Expression):
    if not diff_c.is_trivial_zero():
        return False
```

I think it's clearer if such statements are phrased as

```python
if isinstance(diff_c, Expression) and not diff_c.is_trivial_zero():
    return False
```
since there are fewer nested blocks this way.

Other than that, looks good once tests pass!

I wrote it with nested blocks because `is_trivial_zero()` is implemented only for instances of `Expression`. Is it safe to assume that the second form will never return any attribute error? i.e. that the test following the `and` is performed only 
if the test preceding the `and` is passed? (maybe this is guaranted by Python standard rules)

> Other than that, looks good once tests pass!

The failures reported by the patchbot do not pertain to this ticket; on my computer all tests passed within Sage 8.1.beta1.

Yep, Python supports [short-circuit evaluation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not) for `and` and `or`.
