A doctest of the `midpoint` code in `geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_geodesic.py` relies on exact reproduction of complicated symbolic expressions involving square roots. With recent changes in Pynac the representation of the result no longer matches, although it is mathematically identical.

The ticket changes the doctest to match results numerically.
