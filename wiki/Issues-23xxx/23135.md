sage: x = var('x', domain='real') 
sage: conjugate(x+I)
x + I
sage: conjugate(x)+conjugate(I)
x - I
```

The dependency on "pynac-0.7.9" will be replaced with the Pynac upgrade ticket number after that version was released. This ticket should add doctests for the issue. Usually its title is then prepended with "Doctest:" to give a hint to potential reviewers.
