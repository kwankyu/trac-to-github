Literally **every** time I upgrade sage, the build throws an error on building the documents. This is on sage originally built from source, and upgraded using sage -upgrade over the network.

Now the fix is easy, just run make doc-clean and re-run the upgrade, but would it be possible to make the default behaviour of sage -upgrade to run make doc-clean before doing anything else?

This would also help those first time builders who hit this and don't know how to proceed.

Component: **build**

Keywords: **upgrade doc-clean**
