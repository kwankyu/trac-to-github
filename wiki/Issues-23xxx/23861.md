Expression normalization only works with standard polynomials:

```
sage: (x^2 + x^(-2) - 2).normalize()
(x^4 - 2*x^2 + 1)/x^2

vs

sage: (x^(2*pi) + x^(-2*pi) - 2).normalize()
x^(2*pi) + x^(-2*pi) - 2

also (for different reasons):

sage: (e^2 + e^(-2) - 2).normalize()
e^2 + e^(-2) - 2

sage: (e^(2*pi) - e^(-2*pi)).normalize()
e^(2*pi) - e^(-2*pi)
```

This is necessary for being able to factor all symbolic expressions.

Depends on #23950
