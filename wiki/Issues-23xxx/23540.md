pyopenssl introduced a deprecation in their latest release 17.2.0 (released on 25th of July), see [#658](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/pull/658). As a consequence, when this version is installed is Sagemath, Twisted produces warnings. These warnings appear in various places, in particular when we quit the console

```
sage: quit
Exiting Sage (...)
/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/twisted/protocols/tls.py:41: DeprecationWarning: OpenSSL.rand is deprecated - you should use os.urandom instead
  from OpenSSL.SSL import Error, ZeroReturnError, WantReadError
:0: UserWarning: You do not have a working installation of the service_identity module: 'No module named service_identity'.  Please install it from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/service_identity> and make sure all of its dependencies are satisfied.  Without the service_identity module, Twisted can perform only rudimentary TLS client hostname verification.  Many valid certificate/hostname mappings may be rejected.
```
After installing `service_identity` as adviced it gets a little bit better

```

the latest release of `twisted` still has this `from OpenSSL.SSL ...`, so I don't know what to do here, except suppressing the warning somehow.
