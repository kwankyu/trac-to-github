The following code used to fail in the specialization for polynomials over some rings:

```python
            sage: R.<c>=RR[]
            sage: P.<z>=AffineSpace(R,1)
            sage: H=End(P)
            sage: f=H([z^2+c])
            sage: f.specialization({c:1})
```
should return:

```python
            Scheme endomorphism of Affine Space of dimension 1 over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
              Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (z) to
                    (z^2 + 1.00000000000000)
```

If the base ring of R was QQ, this would work, but if it was RR, it would fail. The problem was in the specialization function, which used a dictionary psi whose keys were supposed to belong to the flattened ring, but instead belonged to the unflattened polynomial ring. Over some rings the built-in coercion functions would fix this while over others they would not. The dictionary psi has been corrected so that the specialization function works as desired.

This fixes the issue. I just made a minor whitespace change.

I think this is just a minor priority since Sage is failing with an error message, we just should be able to deal with that case.
