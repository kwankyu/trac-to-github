Currently `is_eulerian()` accepts parameter `path`, but `is_hamiltonian` does not. This patch will correct that and makes Sage more orthogonal.

Trivial patch to review.

I do not understand why `hamiltonian_path` returns `None` and `hamiltonian_cycle` raises an exception, but that is a place for another ticket.

Good catch, corrected and also one unrelated typo in the same time.

I'm not a graph theorist, but there could be a good reason for differentiating between Eulerian and "strictly" semi-Eulerian.

This is bad behavior IMO to have this inconsistent output. I feel like it should have another argument `certificate` that determines whether or not a tuple is returned with the circuit/path.
