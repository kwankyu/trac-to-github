This is the final ticket in a series of tickets that I have opened this summer in an effort to improve the functionality for complex dynamics in Sage. With this ticket, I plan to modify the `julia_plot` function to support general polynomial functions. The map `z^2 + c` will still be hardcoded so the function will not lose any speed for the `z^2 + c` case. This ticket is dependent on #23720 which implements the plotting of the Mandelbrot set for general polynomials.
