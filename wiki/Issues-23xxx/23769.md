`src/bin/sage-starts` uses `build/bin/sage-logger` (writing into `$SAGE_ROOT/logs`)  and therefore belong to sage-the-distribution rather than sagelib. It should not be installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.

(It could as well be eliminated and merged into `build/make/deps` (the only place from which it is called); this is where many invocations of `build/bin/sage-logger` happen and this one could as well, for consistency.)

Part of #21559. See also #21510.

I think the purpose is to do a very basic check that Sage actually works. I remember cases in the past where Sage seemed to build fine but doing `./sage` would fail. These days, Sage is also used by the build system, so that is less likely. Still, it is good to leave that basic check in place.",

Not quite. I think the purpose is to do a very basic check that Sage actually works. I remember cases in the past where Sage seemed to build fine but doing `./sage` would fail.
