In `legendre_P::eval_pari` there is this:

```
return sum(b * arg**a for a, b in enumerate(pol))
```
Due to `GiNaC::add::eval` mechanics it has quadratic performance, fortunately eased by smart pointer operations. Much better however would be to have the iterator add to an `GiNaC::exvector` and construct the `GiNaC::add` from that. There is `GExVector.push_back` and `g_add_construct` in the Pynac interface already available.
