Some issues (not necessarily caused by the changes here):

- The reference manual page for `sage/combinat/root_system/type_marked.py` is missing from the table of contents. If I visit the page for `sage/combinat/root_system/type_reducible.html`, for example, then the one for `type_marked.py` is listed as being the previous topic, but it's not actually listed on the combinat table of contents. Any ideas why?

- The change in `sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/quiver.py` fixes the mark-up, but the link is not valid. `search_def('save_exceptional_data')` comes up empty, so I can't tell what was intended.

- Similarly, the change in `sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` yields a broken link.

- Same with the change in `sage/schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py`.

Feel free to change back to "positive review" if you think these should be dealt with elsewhere.
