Using a python3 build, one gets

```
----> 1 from sage.graphs.graph import Graph

/home/chapoton/sage3/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph.py in <module>()
   7870     Graph.tutte_polynomial          : "Algorithmically hard stuff",
   7871     Graph.lovasz_theta              : "Leftovers",
-> 7872     Graph.strong_orientations_iterator : "Orientations"
   7873     }
   7874 

TypeError: unhashable type: 'instancemethod'
