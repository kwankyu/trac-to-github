At #22608 the environment variable `$PYTHONPATH` was not set anymore and this got merged into 8.0. But this also breaks the usage of `$SAGE_PATH` . However `$SAGE_PATH` is still mentioned in the [documentation of sage 8.0](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/repl/environ.html) (there might be more examples then just this link.

It should be mentioned at the relevant places in the sage documentation that` $SAGE_PATH` does not work anymore since sage-8.0, and suggest the use of `$PYTHONPATH` instead.

I'm skeptical of even adding `PYTHONPATH`.  Users who use `PYTHONPATH` willy-nilly without really understanding what they're doing (e.g. pointing it to some system python's site-packages) often create trouble for themselves.

I would prefer if Sage came with virtualenv and that there were documentation on how to use it properly with Sage.  But that's beyond the scope of this issue.  I just don't know about documenting `PYTHONPATH` here...

An updated commit that removes mentions of SAGE_PATH and PYTHONPATH. Because SAGE_PATH was removed more than a year ago, this might be appropriate.

Documenting Python's environment variables usage in Sage (e.g. Sage does not like users setting PYTHONHOME), can probably go to another ticket.
