Given a map or point defined over QQbar, you can call _numberfield_from_algebraics to return a map over a number field. However, the resulting object cannot be converted back to QQbar since the embedding information is lost.

The following code used to fail:

```python
R.<t>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
s = (t^3+t+1).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,1)
H = Hom(P,P)
f = H([s*x^3-13*y^3, y^3-15*y^3])
f_alg = f._number_field_from_algebraics()
f_alg.change_ring(QQbar) # Used to fail
```

The problem was that the number field being defined over which f_alg was defined should include an embedding, telling Sage where to send the generator in the real/complex numbers. (After all, QQbar elements all have this embedding information.) This information was present but was not being used when defining the number field (possibly due to a quirk in the code from qqbar.py). The fix now updates the code to specify this embedding when creating the number field.
