It would be cool to have an assertion that was possible to turn on and off, and that weren't caught by `except Exception`.  For example:

```python
class Assertion_Error(BaseException):
    pass
def assert_(F, msg=None, args=(), kwds={}):
    if not callable(F):
        raise ValueError("Must use a callable")
    if assertions_enabled and not F(*args, **kwds):
        raise Assertion_Error(msg)
```

One could probably also have `msg` be lazy as well...
