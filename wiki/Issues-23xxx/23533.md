The compiler complains at

```
../src/scalmc.cpp: In member function 'bool CUSP::ScalApproxMC(SATCount&)':
../src/scalmc.cpp:554:40: error: call of overloaded 'abs(uint64_t)' is ambiguous
                 if (abs(hashCount-mPrev) <= 2 && mPrev != 0) {
```
See the logfile [attachment: cryptominisat-5.0.1.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket23533/cryptominisat-5.0.1.log). Might be due to the recent gcc 7.1.1 that I am using
