Initial report:

> The output of `divisors(n)` for integer `n` appears to be sorted.

>
> If true, this should be documented, so users don't unnecessarily call `sorted(divisors(n))`.
>
> Same for `prime_divisors` and `squarefree_divisors`.

It turns out that for integer `n`, both `divisors(n)` and `prime_divisors(n)`
are sorted in increasing order.

On the other hand, for `squarefree_divisors(n)` the order comes from
using powerset of the list of prime divisors of `n` and in general will
not coincide with the increasing order.

This ticket makes sure the documentation documents that.

This ticket was opened to document that divisors are returned sorted
in increasing order.

Should we review that, and open one (ore more) follow-up ticket(s) to

- make `divisors` and `prime_divisors` return unsorted output by default
- provide an iterator variant for `divisors` and `prime_divisors`

I'm also happy if this ticket is repurposed to something more useful...
but I would not know where to start for that, and I'm afraid this stays stalled.

<a id='comment:19'></a>
Thanks for these comments. I took them into account.

For `squarefree_divisors(n)` the order comes from using powerset of
the list of prime divisors of `n` and in general will not coincide with
the increasing order.
For example, the list of prime divisors of 30 is [2, 3, 5], and the
powers can be [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], giving the squarefree divisors 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 10, 15, 30.

The order that squarefree divisors of an integer are returned in can
be described as follows. 

Denote by `p` the list of prime divisors of `n` sorted in increasing order,
and let `k = len(p)`; then there are `2^k` squarefree divisors of `n` to list.

Let `s` be their list, so that these divisors are `s[j]` for `j` ranging from
`0` to `2^k - 1`.

If `b` is the bit sequence corresponding to `j`,
so that `j = sum(2^b[i] for i in range(k))`,
then `s[j] = prod(p[i]^b[i] for i in range(k))`.

Should this be stated in the documentation?

Thanks for the review!

In the current implementation, squarefree divisors of `n` are
yielded in increasing order exactly when each prime divisor of `n`
is greater than the product of the smaller prime divisors of `n`.
