Really ?? But what is the meaning of `v(self.E.discriminant()>0)` where v is a place of K (which is not QQ) ?? This will just replace `False` by 0 and `True` by 1, which is useless inside a test. But if we remove the wrapping by v, then this does no longer depend on the place, which is absurd.

Of course, I am not an expert. Please be patient with me.
