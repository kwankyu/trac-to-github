Independent of #24824, sage shouldn't check for the exact glpk version in the doctests.

I'm using sage with glpk 4.65 with the [debian patch to ignore the warnings for now](https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/raw/58bbba93a807ca2933ca317501d093a1bb4b84db/debian/patches/dt-version-glpk-4.65-ignore-warnings.patch) and noticed that this doctest checks for glpk 4.63.
