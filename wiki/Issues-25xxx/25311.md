Currently the doctests check for the version of zn_poly. That makes the doctests unnecessarily brittle. If somebody updates zn_poly they have to make a change at an unreleated position and it is an annoyance for packaging.

Why patch this specific test? I mean, I think that most of `misc/package.py` is problematic for packagers.

zn_poly has version `0.9` in nixpkgs, without the patch part. I could translate that just as the names, but that would need to be fixed with every change to the sage version.

And even when not considering packaging I think its best not to test for the exact version. That will always break the doctests with every zn_poly version, even if there was no api break.

Interesting. I don't know what other distros do.

> And even when not considering packaging I think its best not to test for the exact version. That will always break the doctests with every zn_poly version, even if there was no api break.

I think we specifically chose `zn_poly` in this doctest because it is dead upstream (last release in 2008) and the last Sage-specific patch was in 2013. So the scenario that you describe is mostly hypothetical.
