When installing the singular spkg, the folder `$SAGE_SHARE/singular/` is completely overridden. However, `p_group_cohomology` installs two .lib files into that folder. So, singular must be listed as a dependency for p_group_cohomology, so that it will be rebuilt after each upgrade of singular.

Also it adds some files into `$SAGE_SHARE/sage/ext/gap/modular_cohomology`, but (as I just tested) re-installing GAP preserves that folder.

So, I suggest adding just singular to the dependency list of p_group_cohomology.

Component: **packages: optional**

Keywords: **p_group_cohomology singular dependency**
