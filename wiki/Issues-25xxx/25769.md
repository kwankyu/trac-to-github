Can you unify the first line of `is_connected` with the description in the table at the top of the file.

for the lines below, is there a rule on the number of spaces at the beginning of the second line ? usually, we have 2 spaces more than `-`...

```
+    - ``sort`` -- boolean (default ``True``)
+       whether to sort vertices inside each component
 ```

I tried setting `sort=False` by default and only 5 doctests failed in `graphs/`, all for print issues. So I assume that most of our methods are not relying on this ordering.

```
sage -t src/sage/graphs/base/static_sparse_graph.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/graphs/connectivity.pyx  # 4 doctests failed
```
So it could be nice to add `sort=False` to (most of) the calls to these methods, but it might be a lot of work...
