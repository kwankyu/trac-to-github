This is like #25387 but adds `UniqueRepresentation` to classes that weren't using it (specifically in `sage.algebras.quatalg`) but looked like they could benefit.

Depends on #25388

#25672 goes ahead and implements a `__hash__` for quaternion algebras.  I believe this should ultimately be removed as in this ticket (alone with the `__eq__`), but first we need the hypothetical class I mention above.
