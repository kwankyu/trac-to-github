This will break with Python 2 `file` objects, which are not subclasses of `io.IOBase` (they still exist entirely outside the framework of the new `io` module, which I don't like very much but there are probably Reasons).

I believe much of the code in this module would benefit from some duck-typing instead.  I might have already done that in my Python 3 branch--I remember looking at this module before--but I'm not sure.

Heh, the docstring for `from_whatever` is pretty brazen too

```
-  ``data`` - can be a string, a list of strings, or a
   file stream, or whatever.
```

except not "whatever", because if it's passed anything but a string, a list, or a file it silently returns `None` :/
