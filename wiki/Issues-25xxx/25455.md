I haven't tested these, but here's my quick thoughts.

- The `tester` in `root_system.py` looks like you can just remove it.
- You can remove the block about marked nodes (that is handled by `_latex_draw_node`).
- I suspect the whole `CartanType_affine._repr_` is redundant (or the main one is not being properly overwritten).
