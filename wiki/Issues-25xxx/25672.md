Ah, I thought something about this seemed familiar though: #25389

But per my comment, we decided not to go forward with my use of `UniqueRepresentation` from #25389.  Instead we need some kind of class that shares some of the equality/hash implementation of `UniqueRepresentation` without the caching/singleton semantics.

I think if we had that it would make a lot of these `__hash__`es irrelevant.  But currently lacking such a class (I could write it pretty easily I think, but haven't yet) this is fine as a workaround for now.
