<div id="comment:0"></div>

Note the difference between these implementations:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(3^10, impl="givaro"); timeit('list(k)')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.2 ms per loop
sage: k.<a> = GF(3^10, impl="pari"); timeit('list(k)')
5 loops, best of 3: 3.02 s per loop
```
There is clearly room for improvement in the latter, which is basically implemented as iterating over `k.vector_space()` and then converting those elements to `k`.

The attached branch improves that a lot:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(3^10, impl="pari"); timeit('list(k)')
5 loops, best of 3: 44.2 ms per loop
```
(still slower than Givaro but much faster than before)

Finally, some minor unrelated refactoring is done to the conversion PARI -> `FiniteFieldElement_pari_ffelt`.

Do all of those returns in `element_pari_ffelt.pyx` need a `sig_off`, or is that handled by the calling function?

Would it be worth cythonizing the iterator (by making it a function in `element_pari_ffelt.pyx`)?

It's handled by `construct`.

Maybe, but I'd rather do that another time :-)
