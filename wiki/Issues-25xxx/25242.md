```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: F = DynamicalSystem([x^2+ y^2, x*y])
sage: F2 = F.conjugate(matrix(QQ,2,2, [1,2,3,5]))
sage: F2.is_polynomial()
```
When removing dividing out the roots, the exponent is not taken into account.

If the review was positive, there should be no change in the branch. Looking at the code it looks like you added a link to the test. That syntax I believe will fail to build correctly in the docs. See the new branch.

you should also ad yourself to the reviewer field
