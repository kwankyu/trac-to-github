...which is more or less what I had done before:  it's at

http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/mwrank/

(and you may also like to note that from now on my home page is at

http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona
)

For the future I guess I need to do "hg push" to somwhere.

PS the changed files are gpslave.h/cc, parifact.h/cc, marith.cc
