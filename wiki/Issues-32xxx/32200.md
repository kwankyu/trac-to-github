Return values of type `int` lack useful
integer methods such as `factor()`.

We add a section to the developer manual
recommending to return integers as `Integer`.

I think something should be explicitly mentioned about `__hash__` being a definite exception.

More in the bikeshedding category: I think this would be better placed before the `IMPORTING` section as it is more minor than hashing and coercion.
