I think this was fixed in commit 72e7cbb0873b00524eec152da1e5e3c4b20a4724. 

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(GF(2^17), 5, 5)
sage: type(M.random_element())
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
```

Which version were you using?

As pointed out in [comment:1](#comment%3A1) (but not in these words), this is a duplicate of #29818, which was fixed in version 9.2, so the reporter was presumably using version 9.1.
