The complexity of a symbolic expression
can be measured by the size of its expression tree.

We add a `tree_size` method to symbolic expressions
to count the nodes of the expression tree.

- [Ask Sage question 57123, 2021, Could we have a leaf_count() function in base sagemath?](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57123)

In Maple and Mathematica this is called "leaf count",
although it counts tree nodes, rather than only leaves.

Other measures of complexity of a symbolic expression:

- length of the expression's string representation
- number of (first-level) operands (see #29738)
