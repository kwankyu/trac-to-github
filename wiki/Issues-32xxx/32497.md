In contrast to parent classes subclassing `CachedRepresentation` or `UniqueRepresentation`, unique parents that are constructed using `UniqueFactory` do not have specialized `__copy__`, `__deepcopy__` methods:

```
sage:     sage: k = GF((5, 2),'c'); k 
....:                                                                                                                                                                        
Finite Field in c of size 5^2
sage: %timeit copy(k)                                                                                                                                                        
4.4 µs ± 81 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit deepcopy(k)
