Only when invoked as `SAGE_ROOT/sage` or `SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage`, then `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin` should be put in the front of `PATH`.

When the installed `sage` script, `SAGE_VENV/bin/sage`, is invoked directly, it should not put `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin` on the `PATH`.

It fixes a problem when **sagemath-standard** is installed in a user-defined venv. In this case, before this ticket, the installed `sage` script would actually end up running `sage` from `SAGE_ROOT/venv`. 

We ran into this in #29865. The distribution **sagemath-objects**, as of #29865, also installs the `sage` script, and it had this behavior.
