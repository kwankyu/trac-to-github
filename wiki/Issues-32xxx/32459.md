Can you just import it as `Element` and then have an alias `element_class = Element`? The alias will just need to be removed once it moves to the new coercion framework. Otherwise we have to change `Element_hidden` -> `element_class` later on when we move over. Anyways, not a very serious comment, so feel free to ignore. Everything else LGTM.
