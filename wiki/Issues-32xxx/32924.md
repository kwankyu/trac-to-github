<div id="comment:0"></div>

This ticket has the following goals.

First, fix the documentation of `WordMorphism.is_endomorphism`

```diff
-    Returns ``True`` if the codomain is a subset of the domain.
+    Return whether the codomain is equal to the domain.
```
This would match the [definition of endomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism) and the (correct) implementation

```
return self.codomain() == self.domain()
```

Next, add a method to test whether a `WordMorphism`
can be iterated, that is, whether the codomain
is contained in the domain. This method is called `is_self_composable`. Using this new method could be more appropriate than using `is_endomorphism` in some existing code.

Finally, we impose stricter conditions on the input. The current code allows the two following constructions that raise errors with the branch

```
sage: WordMorphism({'a':'a'}, domain=FiniteWords('ab'))
WordMorphism: a->a
sage: WordMorphism({'a':'a', 'b':'b'}, domain=FiniteWords('a'))
WordMorphism: a->a, b->b
```
