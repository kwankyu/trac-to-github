The docker/Dockerfile uses a multi-stage approach to build several related images. However, something is broken since every SPKG is built (at least) twice during a run of .ci/build-docker.sh.

As a result, building docker images takes a very long time and, with this bug, likely exceeds the limits of most CI providers.

Sure, but that just helps with the symptom here I think. Also, the idea of these docker images were that they are the actual [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) distribution.

The wish for to the sagemath-dev image being the actual distribution makes sense.

For the regular sagemath image this wish is I guess less relevant, but having two different build setups for the sagemath-dev and sagemath image doesn't really makes sense to me, since it will mean more maintenance. 

The time limit for ci jobs on github is 6 hours per job for what it is worth.

There are many packages that change quite infrequently, yet take lot of time to build.

If there is an image only allowing changes in sagelib, it would already be quite useful.

As well, I don't even understand why using system packages is any different - do you mean to say that docker images don't allow monkey-patching?
