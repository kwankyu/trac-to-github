The following code leaks memory quite fast, and if I leave it running eventually it will consume all my memory:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QuadraticField(-1),1)
....: while True:
....:     a = x(1)
```
I tried this on a few different versions (9.1, 9.4, 9.5 beta 2) and always saw the same behaviour.
For a polynomial over the rationals this doesn't seem to leak, just for larger degree number fields.
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx#L2122 seems to be the location of the relevant code, in particular this uses singular it seems.

The same thing happens for

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QuadraticField(-1),1)
....: while True:
....:     a = x + 1
```

Component: **memleak**

Keywords: **singular, polynomials**
