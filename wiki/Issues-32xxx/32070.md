https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs

https://pypi.org/project/pythreejs/

https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs/blob/master/pyproject.toml declares a "build-system requires" of `jupyterlab~=3.0`, so we may want to make it depend on the jupyterlab upgrade in #32069.


Depends on #32069
