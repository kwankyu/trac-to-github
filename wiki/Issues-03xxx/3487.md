When sage comes up it announces:

Loading SAGE library. Current Mercurial branch is: worldDomination

turns out, this is the current "clone"... when you are using "hg branches" in your clone it would be nice for it to say something like:

Loading SAGE library. Current Mercurial clone is: worldDomination on branch: riemannProof

In thinking about it, I think this is more general.

So, one clones using sage -clone worldDomination

and then one asks what branch one is on with sage -branch

but, we should be able to clone and branch with the right syntax.  given the current switches, we need to be careful, but we should be able to clone and branch with switches to sage and ask where we are.

so, sage -branch could simply spit out clone and branch... but "sage -b" is an issue
