People try to TAB-discover a method for inversion of `PowerSeries` but can't find it (http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24904/how-to-compute-the-multiplicative-inverse-of-a-series/), so we need a wrapper for `^-1`, named analogously to `PowerSeries.reversion()`.

The same applies to `LaurentSeries`

The name `inverse()` instead of `inversion()` would be more appropriate to my mind, but actually I would say the same for `reverse()` rather than `reversion()`. This is more consistent with other names in Sage, such as `derivative()` (and not `derivation()`) or `truncate()` (and not `truncation()`).
