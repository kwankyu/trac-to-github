A minimal case:

```
sage: (k,n) = var('k,n')
sage: sum(abs(-k*k+n),k,1,n)
sum(abs(-k^2 + n), k, 1, n)
sage: _(n=8)
sum(abs(-k^2 + 8), k, 1, 8)
sage: _.simplify()
sum(abs(k^2 - 8), k, 1, 8)
```
I would expect `_.simplify()` or `.expand()` to give me the result `162` but this does not work.

Related to #9424. One may depend on the other. Relevant questions were:
