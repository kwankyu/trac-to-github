I think the following should not return an empty list:

```
sage: cyclotomic_polynomial(3).roots(Zp(739, 566, type="fixed-mod"))
[]
```

The problem appears to be specific to the `fixed-mod` type. For `capped-rel` and `capped-abs`, two roots are found as expected. So if there is no more elegant solution, one could always compute the result in the `capped-abs` field and then cast to `fixed-mod`.

When computing the roots, one step gives capped-precision.

Then x with capped-precision does not compare == to its image in the same field with fixed-modulus.

So the root is excluded as not being in the given field.
