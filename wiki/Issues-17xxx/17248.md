I have changed the cardinality method of the SetPartitions_setparts class. It used to list the set partitions and now it computes the cardinality using basic enumeration formulas.

Hello,

That's cool you worked on this!

1. To avoid the if/else inside your loop you can use the method `to_exp_dict` of partitions:

```
sage: S = SetPartitions(13, Partition([4,3,3,2,1]))
sage: p = S.parts; p
[4, 3, 3, 2, 1]
sage: d = p.to_exp_dict(); d
{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1}
```

2. Minor remark: if you write

  ```
  a = 1
   ```
   in the source code this is a Python integer. It is not bad to use it but it is confusing if you start to mix them with Sage integer which do not behave the same (especially with respect to division).

3. If you use only Sage integer, there is no need to import `factorial` and `binomial` as they are methods of Sage integers

  ```
  sage: 10.factorial()
  3628800
  sage: 10.binomial(2)
  45
   ```
   Using directly those will significantly improve the timings (the `import` takes time and the function in `sage.rings.arith` are much more complicated and ends in calling these methods).

4. It would be nice to have a test like the following:

  ```
  sage: SetPartitions(13).cardinality()
  27644437
  sage: sage: sum(SetPartitions(13,p).cardinality() for p in Partitions(13))
  27644437
   ```

Do I need to modify the status of this ticket back to "needs review" ?

Yes. I did it. Basically the workflow is

   - author does modif
   - author puts in needs review
   - reviewer complains (and possibly provides commit) and set to needs work/needs info

and you repeat until agreement.
