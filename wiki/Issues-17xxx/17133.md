```
sage: e = Partition([2,1,1]).to_exp()
sage: e
[2, 1]
sage: [type(x) for x in e]
[<type 'int'>, <type 'int'>]
```

Note: as Volker points out in comment [comment:1], there are more places with the same problem. Since this ticket is intended to avoid a doctest failure in #17130, I only fixed this one instance.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Thats really a pattern that is all over the combinatorics stuff:

```
sage: iter(Partitions(4)).next()[0]
4
sage: type(_)
<type 'int'>
```
or

```
sage: g = SymmetricGroup(3).gen(0)
sage: type(g(1))
<type 'int'>
```
I've tripped more than once over this, its really common to want to do `n.factorial()` for some integer from a partition.
