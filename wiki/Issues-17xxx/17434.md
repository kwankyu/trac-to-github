This should be a syntax error:

```
sage: f(x) = 1 ) + ( cos(x)
```

But the preparser turns this into

```
sage: print preparse('''f(x) = 1 ) + ( cos(x)''')
__tmp__=var("x"); f = symbolic_expression(Integer(1) ) + ( cos(x)).function(x)
```

The right fix (TM) is to either implement a full-blown Python+Sage parser  (lex/bison/ply/antlr/...) or hook into the built-in Python parser.
