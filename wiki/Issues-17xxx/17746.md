`sage-native-execute` aims at executing programs out of the sage virtual environment, by resetting some variables. However, Python-related ones are not reset, which causes trouble when one want to launch a command that depends on the system's Python. The `PATH` are also not reset. So, let us reset them too.

See #17735 and #14414.
