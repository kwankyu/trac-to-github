The file `src/sage/structure/wrapper_parent.pyx` is nowhere used in Sage, not doctested, and hasn't seen any non-trivial change since 2008. Moreover, there is almost no actual code, so even if it's not broken, it doesn't do much. Just remove it.

Replying to [@mezzarobba](#comment%3A3):
> Is it broken?

Given that it's not used, not doctested, and not maintained since 2008, it is very likely broken. Moreover, there is almost no actual code, so even if it's not broken, it doesn't do much.

> Does it have a significant maintenance cost?

Not significant, but there is some maintanance cost: every time we deprecate or change something that this module uses, we have to update it.

> Is there a better mechanism to achieve what it was intended for?

Your question seems to assume that this module itself achieves what it was intended for. I don't know if that's the case. Given the little code, I doubt it. In any case, I would need to understand better what it was intented for...

Let me also add that there is no discussion on Trac nor on `sage-devel` mentioning this module, so I very much doubt that it will be missed (and if so, it's still in the `git` history).
