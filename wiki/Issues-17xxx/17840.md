Currently, Sage does not know how to factor multivariate polynomials over the integers:

```python
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: p = 12 * (x*y - 1) * (x + 2*y + 3)
sage: p.factor()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: Factorization of multivariate polynomials over non-fields is not implemented.
```

I propose to implement it using the factorization over `QQ`. Of course it may not be the best possible solution, but at least it is some (temporary?) workaround. This now gives:

```python
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: p = 12 * (x*y - 1) * (x + 2*y + 3)
sage: p.factor()
2^2 * 3 * (x + 2*y + 3) * (x*y - 1)
```

I have a question: Since the computation for non-fields is enclosed inside a `try`/`except` construction, if a computation is long and interrupted with `Ctrl+c`, a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception is raised and caught by the `except` to raise a `NotImplementedError` exception.

What is a correct solution so that it does not return `NotImplementedError`? 

* Should the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception be filtered?
* Should the `try`/`except` be enclosed in `sig_on()`/`sig_off()`?
* Something else?

So it does not make sense to test this in this file.\u00b9\n\nIt would be interesting to have such an example of a non-working case. Though I do not know for which ring(s) do the polynomials belong to the class `MPolynomial_libsingular`.\n\n\u00b9 One may do the same thing for rings of integers of a number field to obtain a factorization algorithm. The point is that the returned factors are not in the rings of integers in this case, so we have to reconstruct them. It's a bit more work than in the current case.",

> You should add an example where the factorisation currently fails (say, over the ring of integers of some number field).

Actually, polynomials over the ring of integers of a number field belong to the class `MPolynomial_polydict` (defined in `multi_polynomial_element.py`) and not to `MPolynomial_libsingular` (defined in `multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx`). So it does not make sense to test this in this file.¹

It would be interesting to have such an example of a non-working case. Though I do not know for which ring(s) do the polynomials belong to the class `MPolynomial_libsingular`.

¹ One may do the same thing for rings of integers of a number field to obtain a factorization algorithm. The point is that the returned factors are not in the rings of integers in this case, so we have to reconstruct them. It's a bit more work than in the current case.

Done.

These both tests were not really needed. I added them in order to give more meaningful error messages. Now, the error message for the `SymbolicRing` is kind of weird, but the test I added was probably not the right place where to correct this.¹ 

For non-integral domains, you know have that `multivariate factorization over Ring of integers modulo 4 is not implemented` (for instance) while with the previous version it said that the factorization over non-integral rings is not implemented. I personally find the previous message more informative, but that is a matter of taste and I am also fine with the current message.


> 4. The message `Factorization of multivariate polynomials over Symbolic Ring is not implemented. Consider using multivariate polynomial rings instead.` is confusing, it essentially says "factorization of multivariate polynomials is not supported, use multivariate polynomials instead".

Not relevant anymore, though I agree with the confusing aspect of this message!

¹ The main problem is that the `SymbolicRing` has no `is_finite()` method. Thus we get a `NotImplementedError` which is not very informative. See #18054.
