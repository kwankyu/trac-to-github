I heard about this coming relatively soon [here](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/17530/mathjax-2-5-alpha?cb=1), which had some interesting commentary about new features.  See [upstream alpha](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/tree/v2.5-alpha).  

I would recommend first doing #17288 and possibly even #17306 before this upgrade, but anyway wanted to create a ticket for it now for when it becomes stable.
