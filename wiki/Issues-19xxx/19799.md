when evaluating `zeta(s)` numerically at arguments where symbolic constants like `pi`, `sqrt(2)`, `log(2)` etc... are involved, it raises an error (in contrast to `gamma(s)`):

```
sage: gamma(pi).n()
2.28803779534003
sage: zeta(pi).n()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```

or, similarly

```
sage: gamma(sqrt(2)).n()
0.886581428719259
sage: zeta(sqrt(2)).n()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```

and so on.

See https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/115

Since this is fixed in Sage now, this ticket should provide doctests.

Depends on #19819

Yes, there appears to be a conceptual problem in that file because when I remove that option the `zeta` problem goes away but then `polylog` complains:

```
sage: polylog(sqrt(2),1).n()
3.02073767948603
polylog(4, 2).n()
...
TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```
