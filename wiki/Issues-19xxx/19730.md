A recent change has restricted the languages supported by the Sage-built gcc 
   https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/afa95419fc45be354358dc797b113c29cdde9f02

This is occasionally `(*)` problematic on Darwin, since some external packages might require objective-c as well. The "Tk" package, for example, can only be built with objective-c support on OSX `(**)`. This ticket suggests to re-introduce support for objective-c.

`(*)` I'm working on a package for Steenrod algebra cohomology that requires a functional, modern `Tcl/Tk`.

`(**)` objective-c is required if the "-enable-aqua" option is selected for Tk. without this option X11 headers are required which are usually not present on OSX.

Component: **build: configure**

One *can* use the Xcode compiler, so that is a functional workaround. I just wouldn't want to force users of the package to install X-code.

To be honest, my package isn't going to be finished or released anytime soon, so for me this ticket is not actually urgent in any sense.

But you need Xcode anyway to compile anything (regardless of whether you use `GCC` from Sage).

I think you need to better explain what the problem is and how this branch solves that problem.

I was under the impression that the Sage gcc is by itself a sufficient compiler for external library code (+ interfacing the OSX-Windows system) without an X-code installation. I might be wrong here, will recheck in time ...

If you feel like closing it, go ahead.
