```
RBF = RealBallField()
RBF(0.42) + SR(1)
```
does not work, since there is no coercion defined from `RBF` to `SR`.

However, conversion works.

Minor merge conflict with `develop`.

Also, I thought it no longer was fashionable to add `is_Foo` methods that just call `isinstance`. But perhaps that only applies to Elements?
