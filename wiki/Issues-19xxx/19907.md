With the increasing number of modules in `sage/coding`, it seems like a good time to clean [the index of modules](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/coding/index.html) related to coding theory.

This ticket:

- makes names and formatting consistent (upper case vs lower case, period vs no period), 
- cleans the list of modules, and
- orders modules under categories to help the reader to easily find what he is looking for.

I pushed the patch, which proposes a new ordering for modules in `sage/coding`'s index and renames some titles for consistency. This is now open for review.
