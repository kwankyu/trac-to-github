We implement the cactus group *J*<sub>n</sub> (of type A). The cactus group has important applications in category and representation theory.

This group is not available in GAP as far as I can tell.

I can definitely add a default coercion to the symmetric group. I should be able to do a general subgroup defined by a particular condition (such as the kernel of a morphism). I will do this now.

`s14 |-> (1,4) (2,3)` is the correct image as `s14` should correspond to flipping the entire interval `[1, 4]`.

I asked Peter Tingley, who asked Joel Kamnitzer, and they do not know of a normal form.

What I ended up doing on this ticket is just iterating over the ambient group J<sub>n</sub> and returning the element in the kernel.

What might work is a kind of argument one sees for presentations of soluble groups, where one has commutator relations, allowing one to "sort" generators in words; but as we have S_n acting, unsolvable for n>4...

I am guessing it would be too much to ask for a Garside-type structure coming from the projection onto S<sub>n</sub>, where every element can be written as `xy^k` where `x` is the natural section of S<sub>n</sub> and `y` is some special element in J<sub>n</sub> (similar to a normal form for the braid group elements, where `y` corresponds to the section of the long element).

Are you thinking that there might be reduced expressions which require using the `x^2 = 1` identity to add letters temporarily to get between them for n > 4?

I'm also emailing Joel and Peter about possible assistance we might get from geometric information.

I don't see an immediate connection, as the presentation there seems to include more relations, of the form `(xy)^m=1` ?

A Garside-type structure would not work here because that is used for passing from the braid monoid to the braid group. So I really don't think this will work for the cactus group.

Daan Krammer has constructed an analogue of the Tits representation for the cactus groups.
He proves this is faithful. The preprint version is:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1273.pdf

[You need to leave out the six term relations.]

Here is an updated version that takes advantage of an embedding into a right-angled Coxeter group that was described by extending that of Mostovoy that is also implicit in Yu.

(Side note: I believe there is an error in Yu about there being a semidirect product with the symmetric group; in particular, I don't think the short exact sequence with the pure cactus group splits.)

I am not quite sure what you are looking for. Nearly everywhere in the docs, the notation `J_n` was clearly noted as the cactus group (the exception being in the method `geometric_representation_generators()`'s doc). Are you wanting a message saying something to the effect of "Despite having the same notation, this is not the Janko group."? I would be surprised if having the same notation would cause any confusion.

It is in the main `misc` catalog. Are you referring to the finitely-presented one? There isn't a known presentation for the pure cactus group AFAIK. We can derive one since it is a finite-index subgroup of the cactus group, but it is algorithmic (which I didn't feel motivated to do; plus it should have a more general implementation, something the `gens()` code likely should be generalized to).
