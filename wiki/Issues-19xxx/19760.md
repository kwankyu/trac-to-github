For speed reasons I want to hang everything of the first 512 bytes; Just running "file" for each of the 50k files in Sage takes a long time. But reading the head of each is just about acceptable, about 10s with warm caches.

Non-Linux systems shouldn't have files with ELF magic. In fact, if they do then I'd like to get an error.

I don't want circular imports

That wasn't my point, I was saying to move the "magic" check to `ELFBinaryFile.__init__()` and raise `NotImplementedError` if it's not magic.

Would it make sense to mark this as `# optional - buildbot` and run it only on the buildbot? I see two reasons:

1. The test takes a really long time (430s from cold cache and 50s from warm cache on my system)

2. I sometimes install custom stuff in `$SAGE_LOCAL` which might not use the `rpath` from Sage.
