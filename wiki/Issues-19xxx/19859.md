Add an index to `matrix2.py`. Or make a tutorial, or something like that.

(How I think this: Suppose a student starts using Sage at graph theory course and founds http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/index.html . OK, maybe needs a tutorial or something, but anyways, works. But if the student starts at linear algebra course and â€‹http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/index.html ... Uh.
