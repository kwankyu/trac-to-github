```
sage: A.<x> = AsymptoticRing('x^ZZ * log(x)^ZZ', QQ)
sage: log(x^4).parent()
Asymptotic Ring <x^ZZ * log(x)^ZZ> over Integer Ring
```
The correct parent should be

```
Asymptotic Ring <x^ZZ * log(x)^ZZ> over Rational Field
```


Depends on #19083

Not tried, but there should be an easy fix in the `_create_element_via_parent_` methods.
