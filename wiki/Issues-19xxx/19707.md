Setting `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY` is broken.

But really, we should not use environment variables and certainly not magic files (`local/share/mp_config`) for this.

@jpflori: are you sure that we want to support installing both GMP and MPIR at the same time? I am referring to this comment:

```sh
# Don't install GMP compat headers and symlinks if MPIR is not the default MP
# library.
if [ `cat "$SAGE_LOCAL/share/mp_config"` = "MPIR" ]; then
    MPIR_CONFIGURE="--enable-gmpcompat $MPIR_CONFIGURE"
fi
```

In my opinion, it is too difficult to get right, so I wouldn't want to support this.

That's a nice goal, but the recent versions of GMP are not 100% supported in Sage at the moment.
