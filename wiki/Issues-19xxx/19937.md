Those are the analogues of the `__sub__` and `_sub_` in `AdditiveMagmas.AdditiveUnital` category, and of the existing implementations in the Cython hierarchy of specialized abstract classes (`MultiplicativeGroupElement`, `RingElement`, `Vector`, `Matrix`).

We started a discussion on sage-devel about moving all of the coercion buisness (i.e. implementation of `__mul__`, `__div__`, etc) at the level of `Element`. See

    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/k1bBQEWB9uI

This would be lost of time to also have this implementation in categories. But it might be a reasonable path for a transition. Anyway, it would be good to advertise this ticket on the thread.

Hi Vincent, Jeroen,

Thanks for the pointer to the discussion on sage-devel. I'll mention
this ticket there.

Due to the lack of multiple inheritance in Cython, we cannot have a
common Cython base class for all parents having the appropriate
multiplicative structure to define `__div__`. Besides there are
parents where you only know at initialization time whether they have
that appropriate structure; the elements of those can there only
inherit statically from Element.

Because of this, putting the `__div__` method in `RingElement` and its
variants (`MultiplicativeGroupElement`, ...) is not sufficient to cover
all the use cases. Having `__div__` there also encourages people to inherit
from `RingElement` with no mathematical justification (see
e.g. `GapElement` in libgap). Hence the need to have a copy of this
method in the categories.


An alternative option would indeed be to move all the `__div__`,
`__mul__`, ...  methods in `Element`. This has the advantage of
enabling coercion for every Sage `Element`. This has the disadvantage
of polluting the namespace of many objects with irrelevant methods.

I don't have a strong opinion myself.

In any cases, `_div_` belongs to this category and this ticket solves
the problem for now in a consistent way with what's done for the
additive structure and friends. It's also trivial to remove/move the
`__div__` method it defines. Therefore, unless moving `__div__` and
friends to `Element` is decided and implemented very quickly, I
suggest that we get this ticket in. I need this feature for the
Sage-GAP interface enhancements I am working on right now in St
Andrews.

Cheers,
                                    Nicolas

Replying to [@nthiery](#comment%3A7):

Hola,

I basically agree with you. Except that spoiling the namespace with `__div__` and `__mul__` is much better than with `numerical_approx`, `subs`, `substitute`, `is_zero`, `cartesian_product`, `base_ring`, `base_extend`, `N`, ...

Depending of how the reheat of the thread goes on we could:
- actually move the `__div__` and friends to `Element` (that should not be hard)
- adopt the (possibly temporary) solution as suggested in your branch. In which case, it would be better to mention in the docstring that we might move this to `Element`

Have nice time in St Andrews!
Vincent

<div id="comment:11" align="right">comment:11</div>

Shouldn't this be `__truediv__` and have `__div__` as an alias as per #18578 for Python3 compatibility?

> Due to the lack of multiple inheritance in Cython

For the record, this has not much to do with Cython, but with Python. Too many things are being blamed on Cython which are really Python issues.

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A8):
> Depending of how the reheat of the thread goes on we could:
> - actually move the `__div__` and friends to `Element` (that should not be hard)

Indeed, not hard, but somebody has to do it. In any case, I would prefer to wait for #269 to avoid conflicts.

> - adopt the (possibly temporary) solution as suggested in your branch.

If it solves an actual problem you're having, I don't mind.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A11):
> Shouldn't this be `__truediv__` and have `__div__` as an alias as per #18578 for Python3 compatibility?

Absolutely.
