This is a bugfix release.

The new tarball is here:

#18459 was just an update. It had nothing to do with the package type (experimental/optional/standard). Surely 4ti2 has been around for long enough to become optional or standard. There was a massive patch setting package types:

```
>build/pkgs/4ti2$ git blame type
ef11087e (Jeroen Demeyer 2015-06-01 10:12:49 +0200 1) experimental
```

We should hold a vote on sage-devel to promote it to optional. (For this it must not fail any tests, etc).

You can setup a vote if you prefer, but I do not remember it being mandatory for a new optional package. It was only switched to experimental because it did not pass all optional tests at that time.
