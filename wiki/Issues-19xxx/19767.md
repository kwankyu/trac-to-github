ATLAS builds lots of executables during the build/tuning process. Not all these use rpath correctly. This causes in particular problems with a GCC installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL` when building ATLAS 3.11.38:

```
./xf77test: error while loading shared libraries: libgfortran.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

If gcc were installed in a separate directory then that would be fine, but since we install its libraries next to a huge pile of unrelated libraries we'll just run into the conflicts again. A cleaner solution is probably to use an atlas-specific compiler wrapper since atlas is at least pretty good about specifying the compiler used.
