This introduces a new "script" type of packages that only run a script. This is supposed to be an alternative for optional/experimental packages so we can use third-party package managers to install things. 

In this case, the R package manager, though it would presumably be useful for TexLive (instead of `src/ext/texlive/texlive-install`) and npm. But thats for future tickets...

scripts depend on all standard packages (just like optional ones). It also depends on jupyter as it calls it to install its kernel specs. On the one hand it would be nice to have the dependencies explicit, but they would also just be wrong if we can't actually test them.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A5):
> if we can't actually test them. 

This describes a way to test dependencies:
[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-dependencies](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-dependencies)

If `make distclean && make base && make PACKAGE_NAME` succeeds, the dependencies are probably correct.

I would certainly like to make `dependencies` mandatory, I am in the process of adding missing dependency files (see for example #19295).

Dear Volker,

1. Great idea ! I am sure a lot of use cases exist in the Sagemath ecosystem.

2. Your ticket (tested against a fresh clone of 6.10rc0) :
* builds, and
* passes ptestlong.
* Installing r_jupyter effectively installs an R kernel in Sagemath's Jupyter notebook.
* This notebook is functional (i. e. one can create a worksheet whose native language is R).

3. However, over Sage 6.10rcO, the Rpy2 interface cannot be used in a Sagemath notebook :
* The "%load_ext rpy2.ipython" command is not recognized
* The "%load_ext rmagic" command is recognized (with a warning), but :
* The %R (and %%R) commands are not recognized

You can compare these results (illustrated in "Untitled3-native.pdf") with those obtained on 6.10rc0+Trac#19638+manual installation of IRKernel in R, which also illustrates the problems with this current implementation :
* uses a different instance of R than the Sage's pexpect interface
* converts the output in strange formats, different from those used by Sages's pexpect interface.

If your goal was strictly limited to providing an R notebook in Sage's Jupyter, I think it's good to go. If you aimed at providing Sage with an alternative interface to R, it needs work (needs [Trac#19638](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19638), IMHO, but I'm biased...).

I would be interested in your point of view in the question I posed in sage-devel. William's sarcastic non-answer misses a part of the point.

Sincerely yours,

This ticket has nothing to do with rpy2, its only about the jupyter R kernel. Really they are two totally independent approaches to using R, one from within Python and the other without Python.

Okay. This clarification (that should go in the description) enables positive review.
