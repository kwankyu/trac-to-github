In order to have an easy-to-use interface for constructing O-Terms (including objects that are not explicitly mentioned in `big_oh.py`, e.g. Asymptotic Expressions as implemented in #17716), this ticket implements the following:

If `O(x)` is called and cannot be constructed by the "old" implementation, the code also tries to call `x.O()`.

Additionally, keywords can be passed to the actual constructor.

Finally, the code of the old implementation is slightly reformatted (to match PEP 8).
