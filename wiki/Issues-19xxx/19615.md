#19593 was a failed attempt to correct the hash

and let us also introduce a nice plot method, using the same coordinates
as the existing latex method

Seems to work and passed tests, but why `graph_border=True` as a default? It differs from `plot()` of other posets and graphs, and it is not even possible to override by user.

Hello, thanks for having a look.

I have removed the `border=True` option.

Yes indeed, I just moved the cordinate-computing code. It should not have changed anything in the view method results. You may want to check that the latex pictures before and after the ticket are the same. You can get examples to look at from the `list(TamariIntervalPosets(5))` for instance.

I think the hash is good to go. This is what I really need for my work.

There remains a question about the eventual possibility to choose the colors in "plot".
I do not really care, but if you want, this can be done.

Frederic

Maybe it best to start with #13827 and then think about general poset `plot()` and only after those think about colors in this one.

ok, damn. I had checked on smaller examples, and the pictures were the same.
I think one could simply add a warning/explanation that the pictures are different:

* the plot is the Hasse diagram of the poset, with two colors for increasing/decreasing covers

* the view is the union of two Hasse diagrams of the increasing forest and decreasing forest.

Would you agree with this solution ?

So this was *not* a `dot2tex` issue?

To be able to comment your suggestion I must understand this better. I will comment this eventually, but for now this is ready for others to comment and review.
