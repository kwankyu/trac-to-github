As reported in [[#19249 comment:6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/19249#comment:6)] the function `Graph.treewidth` makes an incorrect assumption by extending the current 'cut' with vertices adjacent to it only. 

It is fixed by this branch.

Let's hope we will have other methods to compute treewidth soon ;)
