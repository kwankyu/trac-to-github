Surprisingly, `Matrix_dense` doesn't implement matrix multiplication, although the discussion of how to implement specialized matrix types in `matrix/docs.py` suggests it should. See also #17220.

Changed, but why? Cython seems to be able to infer that type.

Done, thanks.

I didn't check the C code. I didn't even know Cython could do that.


Something else: replace

```
raise IndexError("Number of columns of left must equal number of rows of right.")
```
by an `ArithmeticError`. The same exception occurs in Sage as `IndexError` and as `ArithmeticError` but I think the latter is the most suitable.

You also need to doctest this exception.
