When building on Cygwin32, I get the following error:

```
.libs/libpynac_la-numeric.o: In function `ZN5GiNaC7numericD2Ev':
/home/Travis/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pynac-0.5.2/src/ginac/numeric.cpp:621:
 undefined reference to `_imp____gmpq_clear'
```
This indicated to me there is a linking issue with Pynac to GMP. Full log is [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket19663/pynac-0.5.2.log) on #19663.

Fixed by the update to Pynac 0.5.3 on #19744.

FWIW, Pynac's `configure` doesn't check for libgmp, just for its header.

In GiNaC's Makefile we still have

```make
#The -no-undefined breaks Pynac on OS X 10.4.  See #9135
if CYGWIN
libpynac_la_LDFLAGS = -version-info $(LT_VERSION_INFO) -no-undefined
else
libpynac_la_LDFLAGS = -version-info $(LT_VERSION_INFO)
endif
```

though, so it must fail on Cygwin (unless we link to libgmp there).




The libtool versioning (0.0.0) IMHO doesn't make sense either.

Hmmm, do we want to link with GMP on Cygwin only?

It would have been sufficient to add `-lgmp` to `LIBS` in `configure`[`.ac`], either manually or by calling`AC_CHECK_LIB()` (but upstream should decide; not sure why they don't do this already).

New branch linking to gmp on all platforms, adding the proper test in configure.

The patch itself is one line

```
AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp, __gmpz_init, , AC_MSG_ERROR([This package needs libgmp]))
```
in `configure.ac` (this is the patch in `patches/build/`). The patch generated by autotools, however, is much bigger since my versions of the tools do not match with the versions previously used by pynac (my versions are more recent, so it should be for the better).
