sage: tan(2+I).n()
-0.243458201185725 + 1.16673625724092*I
sage: tan(2+I).imag().n()
0.0605381745356926
sage: tan(2+I).imag()
tanh(1)/(tan(2)^2*tan(1)^2 + 1)
```

There is a form that works at
http://dlmf.nist.gov/4.21.E39

See https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/114

Since this is fixed in Sage now, this ticket should provide doctests.
