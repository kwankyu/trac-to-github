The goal of this ticket is to clean up highlighting in the documentation. There are several issues. Right now, we are patching pygments and Sphinx so that they know about the "sage:" prompt. Also, we are telling Sphinx to highlight all code blocks as if they were Python console blocks. There are various other types of code blocks in the Sage docs: Python, Cython, reST, LaTeX, etc., and right now many are not highlighted at all: Sphinx/pygments tries to parse them as the Python console and fails, so does nothing. Even some of the Sage console blocks aren't highlighted correctly, because pygments refuses to parse input like `sage: a?`: valid IPython but not valid Python.

To improve the situation: Sage's console is based more on IPython than on Python, and IPython comes with a lexer to use when building its own documentation. Furthermore, that lexer explicitly allows for customization of the input prompt. So we can get rid of the prompt patches and use IPython's lexer, and it succeeds at highlighting blocks containing `sage: a?` and other IPython-type text. The only disadvantage to this is that IPython's lexer doesn't convert `<BLANKLINE>` in doctest output to a blank line, so we add a Sphinx transform to handle this.

We also mark some non-Python blocks as what they are, to enable their highlighting.

We want Sage's doctest blocks (and most other literal blocks) to be typeset as Python console code. Setting the default highlighting language to `pycon` does this, and it means that we can then not use the highlighting patch for Sphinx.

Currently in Sage, there are some blocks which are not highlighted correctly. See [this page](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/tutorial_free_modules.html): in the first block (containing `CombinatorialFreeModule?`), the prompt "sage:" is not highlighted. With the proposed change, that block will still not be highlighted the way we want, and in fact it will produce a warning:

```
WARNING: Could not lex literal_block as "pycon". Highlighting skipped.
```
We have set up the docbuilding process so that warnings stop it, so we also need to silence this warning.

There are no doubt some blocks in the Sage code which should not be highlighted using `pycon`, but as things stand in current Sage, Sphinx already tries to highlight them using the `default` lexer, which basically means `python3` with a graceful failure if it can't parse it as Python 3: see [the Sphinx docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-highlight_language). Once we set the highlighting language to something other than `default`, we lose the graceful failure, and so we have to silence the warnings.

In my spot-checking, the current non-Python console blocks fail their highlighting and so have no highlighting at all, and that behavior continues with this branch. At some point we could try to modify those blocks: something like

```
Here is a block::

.. highlight:: rest

    stuff
```
But that can be on another ticket.

A few blocks in Sage look like

```
Traceback:
..   <-- should be exactly three dots
more stuff
```
Having 2 or 4 dots means that Sphinx can't handle the highlighting: you can see this [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/shifted_primed_tableau.html#sage.combinat.shifted_primed_tableau.ShiftedPrimedTableau.check), where there are 4 dots instead of 3.

Along the same lines, having extra spaces at the end of `NotImplementedError` causes highlighting to fail [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/power_series/sage/rings/power_series_ring_element.html#sage.rings.power_series_ring_element.PowerSeries.list).

There are several issues. Right now, we are patching pygments and Sphinx so that they know about the \"sage:\" prompt. Also, we are telling Sphinx to highlight all code blocks as if they were Python console blocks. There are various other types of code blocks in the Sage docs: Python, Cython, reST, LaTeX, etc., and right now many are not highlighted at all: Sphinx/pygments tries to parse them as the Python console and fails, so does nothing. Even some of the Sage console blocks aren't highlighted correctly, because pygments refuses to parse input like `sage: a?`: valid IPython but not valid Python.\n \n+To improve the situation: Sage's console is based more on IPython than on Python, and IPython comes with a lexer to use when ben building its own documentation. Furthermore, that lexer explicitly allows for customization of the input prompt. So we can get rid of the prompt patches and use IPython's lexer, and it succeeds at highlighting blocks containing `sage: a?` and other IPython-type text.

-We can accomplish the same thing through a configuration option, as long as we also silence some docbuilding warnings.
+The goal of this ticket is to clean up highlighting in the documentation. There are several issues. Right now, we are patching pygments and Sphinx so that they know about the "sage:" prompt. Also, we are telling Sphinx to highlight all code blocks as if they were Python console blocks. There are various other types of code blocks in the Sage docs: Python, Cython, reST, LaTeX, etc., and right now many are not highlighted at all: Sphinx/pygments tries to parse them as the Python console and fails, so does nothing. Even some of the Sage console blocks aren't highlighted correctly, because pygments refuses to parse input like `sage: a?`: valid IPython but not valid Python.
 
+To improve the situation: Sage's console is based more on IPython than on Python, and IPython comes with a lexer to use when ben building its own documentation. Furthermore, that lexer explicitly allows for customization of the input prompt. So we can get rid of the prompt patches and use IPython's lexer, and it succeeds at highlighting blocks containing `sage: a?` and other IPython-type text. The only disadvantage to this is that IPython's lexer doesn't convert `<BLANKLINE>` in doctest output to a blank line, so we add a Sphinx transform to handle this.
+
+We also mark some non-Python blocks as what they are, to enable their highlighting.

and Sphinx interpreted the extra space in front of `.. CODE-BLOCK...` just as indentation, so the code block was highlighted correctly, just indented more than it should have been.
