There are some bits in plain GMP not present for some reason in MPIR such that Cygwin gets some configure-time flags set differently than the defaults on Linux.  Cygwin's system package for GMP is configured with these different defaults, leading to a build failure in pynac that I don't get on other platforms.

See the upstream PR for more details: https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/342

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.**

Component: **porting: Cygwin**

Keywords: **gmp pynac**

Fixed upstream.  rws confirms there will be a new pynac release in a few weeks, so we can possibly wait on that as well.
