I am slightly worried about why this change is necessary:

```diff
-            sage: timeit('sleep(0.5)', number=3)  # long time (5s on sage.math, 2012)
+            sage: timeit('sleep(float(0.5))', number=3)  # long time (5s on sage.math, 2012)
```
I should note the preparser does not convert `0.5` to an element of `RR`:

```
sage: preparse("timeit('sleep(0.5)', number=3)")
"timeit('sleep(0.5)', number=Integer(3))"
```
If it is just something that is needed, then I will just set this to a positive review, but I would like to know why it is needed.
