After having implemented ribbon graphs and tête-à-tête graphs, this ticket is devoted to implement mixed tête-à-tête graphs which are a generalization of pure tête-à-tête graphs and codify pseudo-periodic
automorphisms of surfaces. The goal is to implement them together with a series of functions that compute several invariants such as the action of the automorphism on the integral homology or the invariants of the associated graph manifold.

Depends on #22016

**Keywords:** tete-a-tete graphs, graphs, combinatorial, geometry

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
