This is a follow-up to #26706 which documented building Sage with Python 3.

The instruction that was added to the README there was to use  `make build`,
since `make` was not working yet with Python 3.

However #26949 makes `make` work with Python 3, and was merged in Sage 8.7.beta1
alongside #26706.

In this ticket, we simplify the instructions for building Sage for Python 3: just use `make`.

We also add a word about testing for Python 3 following #26740.
