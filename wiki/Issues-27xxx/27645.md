When both bounds are positive, this was using the step as a bound..

I just want to indicate that changing the parameter names for the `ComplexPlot.__init__` could cause some code to break if someone was explicitly doing `ComplexPlot(xrange=[-1,1], yrange=[-1,1])`. However, since this is an internal class and the chances of someone doing that are very small, it does not need a deprecation.

Also, I do not understand why you only change `if len(ydata) > 0` to `if len(ydata)` and not `if ydata`.

Otherwise LGTM.

One cannot use `if len(xdata)`, because `xdata` can be an array.
