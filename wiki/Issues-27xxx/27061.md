Numpy 1.16 introduced a slight backwards incompatibility such that the
way we were calling f2py.compile() would no longer work for capturing a
log of the f2py output.

It turns out f2py.compile() doesn't do anything very interesting anyways
and has many redundancies with what we do here: It's easy to call f2py
in a subprocess ourselves with the correct arguments and handle the
output.

FWIW there is an upstream report here: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12756

It was just closed, but wrongfully IMO.
