I don't understand how this could be closed fixed as it breaks the building of the documentation.

```
OSError: /dev/shm/portage/sci-mathematics/sage-9999/work/sage-9999/src-python3_6/build/lib/sage/knots/link.py:docstring of sage.knots.link.Link.colorings:35: WARNING: citation not found: Livi1993
```
This ticket replace `Livi1993` in `sage/knots/link.py` with `Liv1993` in `doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` unfortunately there are still some instances of `Livi1993` left in `sage/knots/link.py`

```
# grep Livi1993 /dev/shm/portage/sci-mathematics/sage-9999/work/sage-9999/src-python3_6/build/lib/sage/knots/link.py
        - Chapter 3 of [Livi1993]_
        - Chapter 3 of [Livi1993]_

How do we proceed now that this ticket is merged?
