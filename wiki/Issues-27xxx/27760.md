One sort of generalized permutahedra consists in putting the starting point, which is usually taken inside the fundamental chamber, on the boundary of the fundamental chamber.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11029 for a recent related paper.

This ticket implements the generalized permutahedra and on the way, adds the fifteen H4 4-uniform polytopes.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H4_polytope for a list of them.

Many of them are quite large and can only be computed in reasonable time using the backend `normaliz`.

Depends on #25097

* missing the word 'polytope' here, I think:

```
The runcitruncated 600-cell is a 4-dimensional 4-uniform in the `H_4`
```
and the same in all the examples.

* Here, you could remove the `[]`

```
sum([adjusted_col[j]**2 for j in range(n) if j != i])
```

apart from that, ready to go..

I have trouble figuring out how this failure occurred. 

The expected block is not as the attached branch would predict. Namely, the second line is absent. I merged the last version of develop into this ticket and made a test on my machine and I got:

```

I get 305 tests in total. Would it be possible to get more feedback on how this failing doctest occurred? (which optional packages were used?)

That's what I thought at first too!

But then, that's the only way I can make sense of seeing 

```
Expected:
    A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2 with a = 1.414213562373095?)^3 defined as the convex hull of 48 vertices
    A 3-dimensional polyhedron in AA^3 defined as the convex hull of 48 vertices
```

which are two distinct consecutive outputs of test, the second of which is not tested. I was thinking that it might preparse the string and remove the not tested things and thus the expected block would now consist of two lines.

Otherwise, I have no clue how come the expected block would consist of two lines, it is simply not as the source entails!?

Puzzled.

From the patch bot shortog, the following information is a bit obscure:

```
Expected:
    There are 7 tests in sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py that are not being run
    There are 3 unexpected tests being run in sage/doctest/parsing.py
    There are 1 unexpected tests being run in sage/doctest/reporting.py
    There are 3 tests in sage/rings/invariants/invariant_theory.py that are not being run
Got:
    There are 7 tests in sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py that are not being run
    There are 3 unexpected tests being run in sage/doctest/parsing.py
    There are 1 unexpected tests being run in sage/doctest/reporting.py
    There are 1 unexpected tests being run in sage/geometry/polyhedron/library.py
    There are 3 tests in sage/rings/invariants/invariant_theory.py that are not being run
**********************************************************************
```

I guess it is the same test that causes a problem, but I have no output to inspect. Also, I am curious, what is an "unexpected test"? It's the first time I see such a thing.
