<div id="comment:0"></div>

Implementing a class corresponding to decorated permutations (permutations in which non-fixed points are assigned one of two possible colors). 

Originally defined by Postnikov in 'Total Positivity, Grassmannians, and Networks' as one of many objects in bijection with totally nonegative cells of the Grassmannian (positively oriented matroids, le-diagrams, Grassman necklaces, equivalence classes of plabic graphs).

I think your code for decorated permutations already does everything that is provided by this code, most of which is just copied from `ColoredPermutation[s]`. I think we can close this as a duplicate.
