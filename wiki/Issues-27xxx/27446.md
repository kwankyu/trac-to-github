We want

```
+            sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ, 't', 0)
+            sage: a = P(1)
+            sage: a(()).parent()
```
returning `QQ` and not `P`.

This would be consistent with other substitutions (e.g., setting all variables equal to `0`) and seems like the more natural result. So LGTM.
