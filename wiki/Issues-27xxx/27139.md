In Sage 8.6, typing

```
sage: R.<x,y,z,t>=PolynomialRing(AA,order='lex(2),lex(2)')
sage: x>y
```

raises a `TypeError`. The error report boils down to

```
/usr/local/share/Sage/sage-8.6/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/term_order.pyc in sortkey_block(self, f)
   1138         for block in self:
   1139             r = getattr(block, "sortkey_" + block.name())(f[n:n + len(block)])
-> 1140             key += r
   1141             n += len(block)
   1142         return key

TypeError: Argument 'self' has incorrect type (expected sage.rings.polynomial.polydict.ETuple, got tuple)
sage:                                                                           
```

I have changed line 1140 in term_order.py to

```
-> 1140             key += tuple(r)
```

which works as expected. Noticing that sibling functions to `sortkey_block()` in term_order.py are all coerced to return `key` as a tuple, I think that this is a localized bug which may be corrected safely as above.

The error appears only with lex being used in a block ordering. Obviously other block orderings do not trigger a call to `sortkey_block()`. This indicates some global design issue, which I do not feel competent to pursue.

> The error appears only with lex being used in a block ordering. Obviously other block orderings do not trigger a call to `sortkey_block()`. This indicates some global design issue, which I do not feel competent to pursue.

This is because `sortkey_lex` returns the exponent tuple as is, which means that the result is an `ETuple` rather than a `tuple`. Similarly, `sortkey_invlex` also returns an `ETuple`. For reasons of efficiency, this might be intended, as converting the exponent tuple to a tuple is not necessary in most cases.

Therefore, your suggested solution looks correct to me. Could you add a doctest please to test that the bug is fixed? For example like this:

```
        TESTS:

        Check that the issue in :trac:`27139` is fixed::

            sage: R.<x,y,z,t> = PolynomialRing(AA, order='lex(2),lex(2)')
            sage: x > y
            True
```
Also, please add your full name in the Authors field of this ticket, so that the patchbots run the tests.
