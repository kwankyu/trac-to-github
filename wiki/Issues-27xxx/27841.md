This looks similar to what had to be fixed for polymake 3.4 in #24905.

```
sage: p = polymake.rand_sphere(3,20)
sage: g = p.GRAPH
sage: g
Polymake::polytope::Polytope__Rational::_prop_GRAPH=ARRAY(0x7fafdafa8308)
sage: g.N_NODES
Member function 'N_NODES' of Polymake::polytope::Polytope__Rational::_prop_GRAPH object  ### should have given: 20
sage: g.N_NODES()
20
```

Other affected properties: `BOUNDED_VERTICES`, `VISUAL`, `LATTICE_POINTS`, ...
