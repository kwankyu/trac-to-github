It might be good if any test for a `__reduce__` method actually demonstrated pickling/unpickling, since that's what this is for.

A more general question though: Although I'm sure there's a good reason, it's not entirely clear from this ticket, or your commit message, why adding this was necessary for Python 3 support?  What exactly is this fixing, and why did this need a special `__reduce__` method when it didn't before?

I ran the tests for this sub-package on an older Python 3 build and had two test failures, one of which was obviously the one that this ticket was intended to fix, so I have updated the description with that additional info.

The question you have to ask is *why* does this fail on Python 3 but not on Python 2? I've spent a bit of time looking into it and this is still not entirely clear to me.  This may well be the simplest and most obvious solution, and I have no problem with it on its face.  I'm just a little unsettled by not knowing why this worked before and now doesn't (even with the same pickle protocol it fails).
