I would really like to focus our Python3 effort on Python 3.7 (#25680) first.

If it weren't for the previous ticket updating `python3-known-passing.txt`, #25680 would have been merged already. At some point, everything worked with 3.7 but because the tests are such a moving target, stuff got broken again.

For that reason, I'm personally -1 on this ticket.

The file hasn't been modified in a month, and it is important to try to catch regressions. I think upgrading once per release is not too often. Did you never want to modify this file? What's your alternative?

What is left to be done on #25680, anyway?
