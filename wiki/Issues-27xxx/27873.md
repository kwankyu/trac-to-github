We add integral curves over finite fields, tightly coupled with global function field machinery of Sage. The curves are space curves, including plane curves, in projective or affine spaces.

The main new functionalities are

- finding all closed points (for each degree) of a curve,

- finding all singular closed points of a curve.

Along the way, some old code in curves section of Sage is cleaned.

This ticket is now a meta-ticket to merge the code in multi steps:
