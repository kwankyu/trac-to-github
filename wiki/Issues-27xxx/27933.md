```
sage: P.<sP> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: F = P.fraction_field(); sF = F.gen()
sage: sF.subs(sP+1)
sP
```
which is clearly wrong.

I can confirm this is wrong and it is something isolated with `subs`:

```
sage: sF(sP+1)
sP + 1
```
Something with the `subs` logic is quite strange. It is assuming that the unnamed parameter input is a `dict`, which is very scary (try `sF.subs(2)` an watch the `TypeError` get thrown). If none of the conditions are true, then it just simply adds the parent generator in. So I think that is what is happening since

```
sage: sP in (sP+1)
False
```

Note that your second test is not good because `sF` is not a variable name of `F`, `sP` is:

```
sage: sF.parent().gens()
(sP,)
sage: sF.subs(sP=sP+1)
sP + 1
```

Note that `sP` (=`sF` as a Python pointer) is the variable, so this is correct. I am not convinced that this should be an error since you could consider it lifting up to the fraction field `R(sP,sF)` and then the resulting polynomial has no `sF` variable, and hence it projects back down to `R(sP)`.

I am not sure I get this: My worries here come from the following (reformulated): I want to do `f.subs(a=b)`, but `f` does not have any generator `a`, then I think an error seems appropriate, right?

What about if `f` is over something that does have `a` as a variable, say `f` is in **Z**[a][x]? It starts getting expensive to do this check recursively every time just to then run the computation recursively.

On the other hand, suppose you are doing something in **Z**[x][a], and you do a `subs` that removes the `a` (say, a special case in a list of things), so now `f` is in **Z**[x] and this raises an error on just this one part of the computation. You have to expand out what could be a simple list comprehension.

So I think the current behavior is the most desirable.

I agree that this would be expensive. This is, I guess, why it is not done and subs always(?) substitutes only in the current structure, but *not* in substructures (like coefficents for polynomials). 

> On the other hand, suppose you are doing something in **Z**[x][a], and you do a `subs` that removes the `a` (say, a special case in a list of things), so now `f` is in **Z**[x] and this raises an error on just this one part of the computation. You have to expand out what could be a simple list comprehension.

So, I always think of `subs` to be something that might change the ring. If you want to subs `a=1` and stay in the ring where you are, you can always do `subs(a=R(1))`.

However, I understand your point and agree that this is somehow desirable.

Nevertheless it remains the issue reported.

From the documentation:

```
sage: sF.subs?
...
   Substitutes given generators with given values while not touching
   other generators. This is a generic wrapper around "__call__". The
   syntax is meant to be compatible with the corresponding method for
   symbolic expressions.
...
```
It expects a dictionary or named arguments:

```
sage: sF.subs({sP: sP + 1})
sP + 1
sage: sF.subs(sP=sP + 1)
sP + 1
```

Maybe the problems arises because `sP + 1` can be turned into a dict?

```
sage: (sP + 1).dict()
{0: 1, 1: 1}
```

One could check the arguments of the `subs` method
to avoid the surprise reported in this ticket.

Possibly with a way to bypass the checks for speed.
