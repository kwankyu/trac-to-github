At the beginning of docbuilding, there are lots of messages of the form

```
Deleting empty directory /Users/palmieri/...../sage/src/doc/ca/intro/static
```
I for one am tired of seeing these, so let's silence them.

We should also move this clean-up so that it's done at the end of docbuilding: if docbuilding produces a bunch of useless empty directories, maybe it should clean up after itself.

Actually, let's clean up the empty directories at both the end (for general clean-up) and the beginning (in case docbuilding was interrupted before clean-up).
