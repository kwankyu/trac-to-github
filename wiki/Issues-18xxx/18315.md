This ticket enhances the currently implemented Huffman module by generalizing it to a q-nary Huffman and implementing a faster decoding method. In addition, some parts of it were rewritten and moved to new modules, which also form the basis for the newly implemented data compression schemes Shannon, Shannon-Fano and Shannon-Fano-Elias.

The implementation is meant for teaching purposes; all schemes provide a verbose output showing the encoding process in detail.

Hello,

Your branch does not apply anymore. It might be related to the recent changes introduced by David and Johan that are now in copy.

Hi Vincent,

someone started to make the current huffman also compatible with Python 3. I did now at least the same changes, but it is also not completely compatible by now.

Quick question: Is it necessary to merge the branch with the current version of Sage (for the automerging to succeed)?

Jan

Quick answer: yes.

If you modify a file that is also modified by some commits in the current beta then there are some merge conflict.
