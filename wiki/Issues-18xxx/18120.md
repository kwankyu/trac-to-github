At the moment, the SEEALSO block is (in the developer guide) marked as "optional". The aim of this ticket is to rephrase this to encourage developers to include such a block with many links.

This will help exploring Sage functions, methods, modules, etc. This should also lower one barrier for beginners which can find related stuff much easier. 
This (seealso-blocks) is also used heavily and Matlab and Mathematica; my feeling is that in Mathematica each function is link to 10 (or so) other functions, which is very good and helpful.

Hello,

It would be cool indeed to have more links, but we can't solve the problem by making it mandatory. In many cases there are just nothing to point to: `_add_` functions, `_init_` functions... But if you want us to change something like that, please ask on sage-devel first.

Hello,

I added a small commit at public/18120 to make the second part of the sentence a bit more explicit. 

About the many links that you added: could we stick to only one (pick the format that you prefer)? It seems that you want to show the different ways to create links in ReST, but that is already explained somewhere and the sentence that follows is precisely there to tell users where.
