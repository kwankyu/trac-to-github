Allowing the user to specify an field/ring when creating an matroid.

Example, Wheel would have two new options

```
def Wheel(n, field=None, ring=None)
```


```
matroids.Wheel(4, field=GF(3))
```


yields a ternary matroid.

I have made an attempt for the wheel matroids. 
It returns regular matroid if either no ring/field specified, or the ring is the ring of integers.
