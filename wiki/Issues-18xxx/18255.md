`brun` fails horribly:

```
sage: brun.n()
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
sage: brun?
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
sage: brun??
NotImplementedError: brun is only available up to 41 bits
```
and this leads to sporadic failure of `random_expr`, falsifying patchbot test results.

Interesting!  (Do you have a reference?  I can only find references to estimates using twin primes < 10 to the something.)

Are there any (other?) constants known to some number of bits only of potential interest?  I bet there are, but maybe it's not worth keeping the class around for that.

(Deprecation?  Just asking.)

The class is buggy, which was the original reason that this ticket was created. If you remove the constant and keep the class, you are just hiding that problem.
