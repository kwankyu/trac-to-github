<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

All test passed and the changes look good to me.

There are still some overlooked `map`s in the files of `src/sage/combinat/*`.
But I will create a followup ticket/patch to address those (so that the effort to review the current patch is not wasted).
