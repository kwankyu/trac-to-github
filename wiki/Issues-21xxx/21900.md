> How is this related to Sage?

I would like to make vaucanson as an optional Sage package.

Question: I am trying to find a workaround. I was thinking to add a patch on Cython-0.25.1. But where is the file backports_abc.py ? It does not seem to be inside of Cython-0.25.1 ?

Ok, now I see. The solution to this ticket to update Sage standard package `backports_abc` from version 0.4 to 0.5.

Jeroen, if you agree, I will change the title of this ticket to "update backports_abc to 0.5" and I suggest to not close this ticket as "won't fix".

> Why the `.p0` in the version number?

For the same reason as there was a `.p0` in the version number for 0.4 without any patches to apply. So I removed the `.p0` to be consistent with the fact that there is no patches to apply.

I also added a link to the tarball available on pypi in the first line of description of this ticket.

Needs review.
