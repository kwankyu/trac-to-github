Try

```
sage: G = DiGraph({0: [0,1]}, loops=True)
sage: G.show()
```

The loop-edge from `0` to `0` is very small. However it is better with

```
G.show(edge_thickness=3)
```

Also I was asked why it has no arrow head. Maybe it could be added? But anyways, why thickness can not be changed in digraphs?

Added edge_thickness functionality for digraphs. The problem was that arrow2d has width and not thickness.

The edge_thickness functionality only works for loops of fixed points. For example,

```
G = DiGraph({0: [0,1]},loops=True)
G.show(edge_thickness=1)
G.show(edge_thickness=15)
```
only changes the thickness of the loop at 0 and not the thickness of the arc from 0 to 1.
