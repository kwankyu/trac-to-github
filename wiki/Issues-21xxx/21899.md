According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieltjes_constants as well as
to http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.2.E4, the Laurent series expansion of the Riemann
zeta function around s=1 is

```
zeta(s) = 1/(s-1) + gamma_0 - gamma_1 (s-1) + O((s-1)^2).
```

However, sage says

```
sage: zeta(s).series(s==1, 2)
1*(s - 1)^(-1) + (euler_gamma) + (-1/2*stieltjes(1))*(s - 1) + Order((s - 1)^2)
```
(note the denominator 2 in the coefficient of (s-1)).

Numerically,

```
sage: stieltjes(1.)
-0.0728158454836767
```
and Wikipedia states that

```
gamma_1 = −0.0728158454836767248605863758749013191377363383 	 ...
```

It seems that there is an incorrect factor in sage (this is now fixed and doctested).

When fixing this, the documentation of stieltjes should be improved to actually contain a definition of the stieltjes constants instead of simply stating that "The Stieltjes constants are used in the series expansions of zeta(s)."


Depends on #21855

I suggest to have one doctest with slightly increased precision for zeta around 1, just to see more than one stieltjes constant.
