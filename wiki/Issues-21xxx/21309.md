Thebe is a Jupyter javascript plugin for static sites that allows to render
selected divs of an HTML page as live cells connected to a Jupyter server.

- Code repository and documentation: https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe
- Example/demo: https://oreillymedia.github.io/thebe/

Ticket #20690 aims to use this technology to implement live documentation
in the Jupyter notebook. Indeed, live documentation is one of the features
we had in the legacy Sage notebook and that was not yet available in Sage
when using the Jupyter notebook.

A first implementation of #20690 was entangling thebe.js within Sage source
code. Since upstream is well-defined, the aim of this ticket is to instead
package it the usual way, and #20690 is now based on this packaged version.

The zipball can be found at
https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe/archive/9624e0a07a00026103dce1a3e32bbfbf90a6d0f9.zip
and should be renamed `thebe-9624e0a0.zip`
(upstream does not propose explicit releases).

It can also temporarily be downloaded at
https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~monteil/hebergement/tmp/thebe-9624e0a0.zip

Most javascript libs have dual names, for example `node` vs `nodejs` or `d3` vs `d3js`. Since we used the `*js` name for in other packages, i took that one, but indeed, in the case of `thebe` there is no `*js` version. So i renamed the package `thebe`as suggested.

It is not overkill, because the tarball of "the whole repo" is 1.2M while "the only one file" is 1M. Indeed this only one file is the compiled version of the rest (from coffee+less+js to js), which is the source (+ a few examples). Most js library ship things that way with the compiled result included. Compressed, it would make a 300K archive. Of course, we could make a `sage-src` script to recreate such a tarball.

With the current situation, we have a well-defined origin for the zip-ball, easy to fetch from upstream, easy to update, easy to maintain, which follows the standard Sage packaging process.

Hardcoding things within `src/` is much worse, since:
- almost nobody will notice when the package bitrots
- we create a separate process than standard packaging, so only experts will be able to update it
- each time the package is updated, we get one additional magabyte in the Sage git repository (note that thebe.js is a compiled version, so the file is basically a single 1M line of js that will change at each update). I prefer by far having the git tree only explode by a few bytes (version number + hashes) at each update than 1M at each update.

<putting distro hat on> I generally agree with you on that point. I started getting agitated on this ticket after looking into packaging this for Gentoo and going `WTF` - what am I even supposed to do. Possibly I don't have experience in packaging `.js` stuff but it really left me wondering. If someone with experience packaging for debian would comment on that kind of case I'd be delighted.
