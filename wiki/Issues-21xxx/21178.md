Wow, you really edited them *by hand*!?

There are colons missing after `OUTPUT` in `src/sage/combinat/sf/dual.py` and `src/sage/combinat/words/finite_word.py`.  Just looked at the diff though.

I only noticed afterwards the branch is public, and then did the two changes myself.

Unfortunately then I started making some corrections (mostly markup) in addition -- a can of worms at least in the case of `finite_word.py`... 8/

I'll revert the two changes you already made and then push my changes.

Sorry, I missed your previous post.

I actually (also) just normalized the few instances of `Return` to `Returns` because the vast majority of functions and methods in that file uses not just `Returns`, but also `Applies`, `Tests`, `Computes` and the like.

Wasn't aware that finally one form was agreed on, since this discussion happened a couple of times, essentially coming to the conclusion that it should be consistent within a file or package.

I'll try to change everything to imperative form then (although I don't like it, and a mathematician shouldn't either, perhaps except for some very computional ones, since you don't *tell* a function to behave like this or that, but define its meaning, and a function application *equals* some expression you obtain by term rewriting -- the only imperative being telling some interpreter or solver to *evaluate* something according to given definitions).
