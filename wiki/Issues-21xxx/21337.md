On integer polynomials there are two quite similar methods `pseudo_quo_rem` (implemented on the generic polynomials in `polynomial_element.pyx`) and `pseudo_divrem` which is a wrapper of FLINT `fmpz_poly_pseudo_divrem` (see `polynomial_integer_dense_flint.pyx`).

Note that FLINT also has fast versions of Cohen algorithm with `fmpz_poly_pseudo_divrem_cohen` and `fmpz_poly_pseudo_rem_cohen`.
