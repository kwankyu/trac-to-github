<div id="comment:0"></div>

We should try to fix these warnings:

```
warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
```

There are 3 different issues:

1. The warnings appears several times at the top-level (not inside a package build) and during the build of the Sage library. This can probably be fixed by moving this snippet from `sage-env` higher up:

```sh
# If MAKEFLAGS exists, assume it got set by make.
# Therefore, remove all flags from $MAKE
if [ "${MAKEFLAGS-__unset__}" != "__unset__" ]; then
    MAKE=`echo "$MAKE" | sed 's/ .*//'`
fi
export MAKE
```

2. For several packages, the warning correctly appears because we explicitly force `-j1` (presumably to fix parallel build issues):
- `brial`
- `gap`
- `pari`
- `pkgconf`
- `python2`
- `singular`
- `zeromq`

3. Other packages where this warnings appears:
- `openblas`: no idea where it comes from, probably the `openblas` build system itself.

In Sage, we don't use `make` for all Python-related builds, in particular the build of the Sage library and the documentation. For this, we actually look at the environment variable `MAKE`.

OK, would this mean that it's just an unfortunate choice of the name for this variable?

I've had this same thought before--really we should not be passing down `MAKE=make -jN` to sub-makes.

The problem is that for Sage's build it's being used for cross-purposes.  For packages that use make we want them to be able to take advantage of parallel builds (but jobserver mode is disabled that means the number of jobs started by make can actually well overtake `N`).  But at the same time we want to take advantage of it for Sage to build multiple packages simultaneously.

How about this:

```
$ cat Makefile 
all: opts

opts:
	@echo $(MAKEFLAGS)
```
Now:

```
$ make -j10
-j10 --jobserver-auth=3,4
```
That is, you can parse top-level MAKEFLAGS and get the value you need.
