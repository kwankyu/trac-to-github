This is to fix the tests in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.palp_database`, which were irregularly failing on Cygwin.  I don't think there's really anything Cygwin-specific about the issue, actually.  It just tends to exhibit itself on Cygwin because process shutdown takes longer, giving a wider window for the race condition described below.

This method had some code to force the PALP process to shut down at the end of iteration, rather than waiting for it to complete naturally.   However, this was failing randomly, at least on Windows, due to a race condition where the process could end between calling `poll()` and calling `terminate()` (and/or `kill()`)--the `terminate()` call would in turn cause an `OSError` ("No such process").

The newly added `terminate()` context manager does effectively the same thing as the old code, but also makes sure to close any streams, and handles the aforementioned race condition better.

Since the `terminate()` context manager is fairly generic, there is probably a better long-term home for it than here.

As discussed in #17864, a more general problem here is that `kill()` should not return an error when sent to already exited processes, and the fact that it does on Cygwin is probably a misfeature, so I have reported it upstream: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-08/msg00188.html  This issue isn't *necessarily* unique to Cygwin though.

**Update:** The Cygwin issue is now fixed upstream: https://cygwin.com/git/?p=newlib-cygwin.git;a=commitdiff;h=86f79af827729f3968d8b3b8f860ac29d200da0d  No harm in checking for this behavior regardless though.

Depends on #22695

This `terminate()` context thing obviously does not belong in `palp_database.py`, it could be used more generally.

Since it seems vaguely related to `src/sage/parallel/safefork.pyx`, I would actually propose to move your new code and `safefork.pyx` to a single file, say `src/sage/interfaces/process.pyx` (or whatever you want to call it).

For the purposes of PALP, would it be possible to just do a normal process termination? That is, work around the Cygwin bug but don't do stuff like sending `SIGKILL` in case the process does not terminate within a given time.

I know this needs other work, but when I build the docs with this fix applied I get:

```
[dochtml] OSError: [geometry ] /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/polyhedron/palp_database.py:docstring of sage.geometry.polyhedron.palp_database.terminate:31: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```

I can't for the life of me figure out what this needs.  If I look at other docstrings there are plenty that have a blockquote at the end of the docstring with no newline.  But even when I add an additional newline it still complains.  Anyone seen this before?

You need to use a `r"""` string to make the `\n` literal instead of an actual newline.

As suggested I combined the `terminate` context manager and the `ContainChildren` context manager into a single module called `sage.interfaces.process` (to me that still seems like an odd place for it but I don't have a better suggestion).

Still an open question is what to do with `sage.parallel.safefork` and it should be kept for backwards compatibility?

Do you have a reference for this claim about `SIGHUP`?

```
it also first closes all standard I/O pipes, which should send a SIGHUP.

Writing to a closed pipe can give `SIGPIPE` but I don't think that just closing a pipe would send any signal.
