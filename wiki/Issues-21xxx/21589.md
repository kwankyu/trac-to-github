As a follow-up to #21539, let's have `./configure --enable-silent-rules` make `make V=0` the default.

To clarify, the default is the current verbose output.
With #21539, users type "make V=0" if they are tired of seeing the output.
With this ticket, users type "./configure --enable-silent-rules" once if they are tired of typing "V=0".

The Makefile rules are already flexible enough for that in #21539, using `$(AM_V_at)` instead of `@` (borrowed from automake). 

The present ticket would just set some defaults of Makefile variables. The rules won't have to change.
