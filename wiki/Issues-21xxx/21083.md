We currently work around BRiAl 0.8.5 not building in C++11 mode by passing `-std=c++98`, which is odd.

**Fixed upstream**: [https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/issues/11](https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/issues/11)

Also the patch from https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/pull/15 is added, which is needed for #23943.

**Tarball**: https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/releases/download/1.0.1/brial-1.0.1.tar.bz2

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.**

Yes upstream is me for all that's worth [in a maintenance capacity only) and I meant to do this. Anyway those issues were technically addressed in 0.8.7, `brial` should compile with C++11. The only issue is that you need at least C++98. If we decide to default it to C++11 we must make sure that the sage extension is also compiled with C++11.
