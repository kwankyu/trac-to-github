```
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/misc/package.py", line 139, in sage.misc.package.pip_installed_packages
Failed example:
    d = pip_installed_packages()
Expected nothing
Got:
    You are using pip version 8.1.2, however version 9.0.0 is available.
