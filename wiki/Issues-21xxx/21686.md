The docs for 3d graphics save claim to save png files using the tachyon renderer by default.  They don't (they use jmol).  Also, you can explicitly specify tachyon (or anything), and that is ignored.  All these are the same:

```
sage: icosahedron().save('a.png', viewer='tachyon')
sage: icosahedron().save('b.png', viewer='jmol')
sage: icosahedron().save('c.png', viewer='my friend jim')
```
