I get this when installing `ecm`.

A workaround is:

```
cd automake-1.11.6/share/ && ln -s aclocal-1.11/ aclocal

```

Unclear if this a bug of a specific automake version, or a general shortcoming of the installation scheme of our autotools. This needs investigating.

The directory it's complaining about is a path that `aclocal` searches for "system-wide" m4 macros (which since we install a bunch of automake versions ends up localized to `local/automake-<version>`).  Some newer automake versions are creating this directory by default (empty, except for a `README` file) whereas older versions, it seems, do not create it by default.

For older versions we may have to create it.

`aclocal` has a function that scans this directory for m4 macros, but the function errors out if the directory does not exist (which itself seems a bit unnecessary...)

Looks good to me.

It seems to be recommended though that the patch level is increased when there is a change to the package like this.
