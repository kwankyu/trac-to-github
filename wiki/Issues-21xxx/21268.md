```
sage: Partitions(5, min_slope=1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: the minimum slope must be non-negative
```
I guess that it should be "non-positive" instead...

I even think that `min_slope=1` should be allowed. There is no lower bound on `max_slope`, e.g.

```
sage: Partitions(5, max_slope=-100).list()
[[5]]
```
And I would expect

```
sage: Partitions(5, min_slope=1).list()  # bug ?
[[5]]
```
