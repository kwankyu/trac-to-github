Did you run timings? I'm very slightly worried about the extra push/pop operations in a second list. I doubt it will be much of anything, but I'm allowed some slight paranoia I hope. :P

No, I did not. But now I tested with list of all 12-element lattices. There are 262776 of those, and 2761 are supersolvable. It takes less with this patch to compute (i.e. the time is too short to measure), slightly below 25 seconds. I also tested with chain of 500 elements and got similar results.

Paranoia is a good thing.
