The `__init__` method for `DisjointEnumeratedSets` contains the following lines:

```
        if category is None:
            # try to guess if the result is infinite or not.
            if self._family in InfiniteEnumeratedSets():
                category = InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
            elif self._family.last().cardinality() == Infinity:
                category = InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
            else:
                category = FiniteEnumeratedSets()
```
For some finite enumerated sets the only way to determine their cardinality is to generate all of the elements and count, so the `elif` branch is potentially quite slow. It seems to me that it is better to write

```
       if category is None:
            # try to guess if the result is infinite or not.
            if self._family in InfiniteEnumeratedSets():
                category = InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
            elif self._family in FiniteEnumeratedSets():
                category = FiniteEnumeratedSets()
            elif self._family.last().cardinality() == Infinity:
                category = InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
            else:
                category = FiniteEnumeratedSets()
```
This change does not break anything, should speed some things up and it was the source of a bug that I have just spent some time hunting for. Arguably, the `self._family.last().cardinality() == Infinity` could be removed.

Of course, if the category is given explicitly then this issue does not arise but I always thought that part of the point of such constructs is not to have to do this.

<a id='comment:4'></a>
The family being a finite enumerated set is not enough to guarantee that the disjoint union is finite.  For example without this branch we have

```
sage: F = Family(range(10), lambda i: ZZ)
sage: D = DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets(F)
sage: F in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
True
sage: D in InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
True
sage: D.cardinality()
+Infinity
``` 
but your patch will change this!!!

Actually the current code is also already buggy since just checking wether family.last() is infinite or not is not enough!

```
sage: F = Family(range(10), lambda i: ZZ if i==0 else Set([]))
sage: D in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
False
sage: F = Family(range(10), lambda i: ZZ if i==0 else Set([]))
sage: D = DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets(F)
sage: D in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
True
sage: D.cardinality()
+Infinity
```

So a correct implementation should check wether all elements in the union are finite and make a FiniteEnumeratedSet in this case and otherwise make an InfiniteEnumeratedSet
