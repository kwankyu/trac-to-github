sage: cot(float(.1))
(9.966644423259224+0j)
```

This causes a plot of cot() on the real axis to fail. Sample output:

```

```

There is no problem plotting 1/tan().

When inserting a print at this line:
https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/inifcns_trig.cpp#L777
in order to print what is returned there I get:

```

```
which is exactly `cot(0.1)` and does not look complex. So Pynac does not seem the direct cause of it.

I downloaded older binaries to determine the version in which this error first occurs. The cotangent plots just fine in 7.1 and fails in 7.2.

Sage 7.2.rc1 included Pynac 0.6.5, which is precisely the last time the cotangent function was modified in Pynac. That is unlikely to be a coincidence.

This is not a graphics issue. The plotting method returning the error hasn't been modified in years. And this is not the first time in my experience a change in Pynac has had consequences for plotting (#20818).

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

The issue is when you pass a floating point, not a `sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral`:

```sage
sage: cot(float(0.5))
(1.8304877217124513+0j)
```
in contrast with:

```sage
sage: type(sin(float(1.1)))
<type 'float'>
```
Thus the bug is likely coming from that the internal plot functions use python/machine floating points as they are Python (i.e., not run through the Sage preparser).
