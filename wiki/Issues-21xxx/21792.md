On my OS X machine, the change to `ecm/spkg-install` leads to

```
./spkg-install: line 293: syntax error: unexpected end of file
```
Undo the change and it works fine. (The `-` in `cat >foo.c <<-"EOF"` means to strip leading tabs, and `<<` is looking for just `"EOF"` all by itself, so the line `EOF` needs to be indented strictly by tabs or not at all.)
