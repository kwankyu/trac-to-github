Check documentation for poset functions that returns a (di)graph.

Changes are minor things, just unifying some wording, moving examples that are clearly tests to tests-block etc. Also

- Remove `wrapped`-parameter from `hasse_diagram()`, as it did nothing.
- Fix typo in `lattices.py`, "quantum" was in wrong place.
- Move `breath()` last in list in `lattices.py`, as other functions return a Boolean value.

This continues the serie of #18925, #18941, #18959, #19141, #19360, #19435.

Kevin, I am continuing this serie. Compiling now, so not ready for review yet.

Darij: An example in `frank_network` contains numbers 12, -13, 14 and 16. Is there some reason for that?
