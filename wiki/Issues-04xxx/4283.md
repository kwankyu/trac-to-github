(NTL computes extra information that would require a hack into fpLLL to get and might not be worth it.)  This patch allows NTL to beat MAGMA on many examples (it still is a little slower than MAGMA (but faster than SAGE) on irreducible polynomials).  I think that the cross over between Pari's factoring and NTL's factoring should be re-evaluated (currently Pari is used for polynomials of degree 30 through 300) if not just use NTL for all polynomials now.  \n\n**Assignee:** anovocin\n\n**Keywords:** NTL, LLL, Univariate\n\nIssue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/4283\n\n",
