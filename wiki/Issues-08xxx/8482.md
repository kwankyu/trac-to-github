Task: in the static documentation that appears embedded in the
notebook upon, say,

        sage: sage.categories.primer?

add a link to the corresponding live documentation page
(e.g. http://localhost:8000/doc/live/reference/sage/categories/primer.html)

This would be very handy, and make a strong advertisement for the live
documentation (a really cool feature that I had never stumbled upon
until Mike hinted me about it; and apparently, no one at Sage 20 knew
about it either).


Upstream: **Reported upstream. Developers acknowledge bug.**

CC:  @sagetrac-sage-combinat

Component: **notebook**

This would still be nice to have, not just for the classic SageNB, but also in the Jupyter kernel (if possible), or at least links to doc.sagemath.org if a local copy of the docs is not available.
