Looks good. The documentation for these two modules now appear in the reference manual:

* `sage/algebras/iwahori_hecke_algebra.py`
* `sage/combinat/kazhdan_lusztig.py`

The module `sage/combinat/kazhdan_lusztig.py` has some bad ReST formatting, which results in a warning when building the reference manual. See #8310 for a patch to fix this.
