As the subject says. Even after fixing warnings in building the HTML version of the reference manual as per #8819, building the PDF version hangs while processing a reference to graphviz:

```
Underfull \hbox (badness 6380) in paragraph at lines 410101--410105
[]\T1/ptm/m/n/10 Aric Hag-berg, Dan Schult and Pieter Swart. Net-workX doc-u-me
n-ta-tion. [On-line] Avail-able:
! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.410122 \bibitem[dot_spec]{dot_spec}
                                     {\hypertarget{dot_spec}{}
```
This is traced to the function `graphviz_string()` in `sage/graphs/generic_graph.py`.
