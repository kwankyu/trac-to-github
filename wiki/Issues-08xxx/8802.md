This is inconsistent with other versions of sqrt():

```
sage: QQbar(2).sqrt()
1.414213562373095?
sage: QQbar(2).sqrt(all=True)
```
In addition, there should be a parameter "extend" to handle this:

```
sage: AA(2).sqrt()
1.414213562373095?
sage: AA(-2).sqrt()
1.414213562373095?*I
```
In the second example, we should not return a root in QQbar unless extend=True.

Patch based on 4.4.2 and works fine on 4.4.3. The two problems identified by cremona have been resolved:

```
sage: QQbar(2).sqrt()
1.414213562373095?
sage: QQbar(2).sqrt(all=True)
[1.414213562373095?, -1.414213562373095?]
```

The following command 

```
sage: AA(-2).sqrt(extend=False)
``` 

returns an error, like it should.
