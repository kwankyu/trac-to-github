The method "word_problem" in the matrix groups class is broken in two separate ways. Firstly, it's supposed to allow you to specify a custom set of generators but it silently ignores them and uses the default ones. Secondly, it returns a Factorization object which assumes (!) that the group is commutative, and hence the results are complete junk for nonabelian groups.

I have a rough patch for this but it needs some polishing (mainly adding tests and docstrings).

The code seems reasonable, the docstring looks good, applies to 4.4.2.a0 okay and passes sage -testall
(except for unrelated failures).
