There is a minus sign in the code for diamond operators which shouldn't be there; what actually gets returned is the diamond operator times the star involution! In particular, ```<1>``` really ought to be the identity map. This patch corrects the error and adds a doctest to prove it. (This is needed for some code I wrote with Jared Weinstein at the 2010 Montreal conference, in which it's really vital to work with sign 0 symbols.)
