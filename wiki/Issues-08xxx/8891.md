**Attachment:** [trac_8891.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8891/trac_8891.patch)

It was explicitly disabled long ago (before Trac), but I don't see any reason why it should be now.

Without the patch, I get, e.g.,

```sh
mpatel@sage monoids$ sage -t .
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 0.0 seconds
mpatel@sage monoids$ 
```
With the patch, I get

```sh
mpatel@sage monoids$ sage -t .
sage -t  "./string_monoid_element.py"                       
         [2.1 s]
[...]
```
