This is odd:

```python
sage: R=GF(2^283,'a')
sage: x=R.random_element()
sage: y=R.random_element()
```

First, note that squaring is slower than multiplication:

```python
sage: %timeit z=x^2
625 loops, best of 3: 3.79 µs per loop
```

```python
sage: %timeit z=x*y
625 loops, best of 3: 3.17 µs per loop
```

Now observe that squaring done differently is indeed faster:

```python
sage: %timeit z=x*x
625 loops, best of 3: 1.91 µs per loop
```

This is mainly because of the Sage Integer in the exponent:

```
sage: R=GF(2^283,'a')
sage: x=R.random_element()
```

```
sage: two=2
sage: %timeit z=x^two
625 loops, best of 3: 4.07 µs per loop
```

```
sage: two=int(2)
sage: %timeit z=x^two
625 loops, best of 3: 1.01 µs per loop
```

This is still slightly slower than normal multiplication, probably because of overhead in the `^` operator:

```
sage: %timeit z=x*x
625 loops, best of 3: 834 ns per loop
```

I suggest to close this ticket as "invalid" because this is essentially impossible to fix...

I think "needs_review" as not intended.
