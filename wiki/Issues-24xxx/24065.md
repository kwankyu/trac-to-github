<div id="comment:0"></div>

Factorization of non-monic polynomials seems to fail sometimes.

```
sage: R = Zp(2,type='fixed-mod',prec=3);P.<x>=R[]
sage: p=(1 + 2)*x^2 + (1 + 2)*x
sage: p.roots()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PariError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
.....
PariError: impossible inverse in diviiexact: 0
sage: p=p//p.leading_coefficient()
sage: p.roots()
[(1 + 2 + 2^2 + O(2^3), 1), (O(2^3), 1)]
```
And the same for `.factor()`

After all there is a simple workaround by norming the polynomial in sage and only then giving it to pari. It seems to work fine for monic polynomials.
