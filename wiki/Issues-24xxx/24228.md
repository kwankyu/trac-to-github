This is the problem with using doctests everywhere.  From a documentation standpoint looking at the repr is more interesting.  It depends, to me, if the test is in an "EXAMPLES" block or a "TESTS" block.  In the former case I think it should be more interesting for reading purposes.

Also, the point of #24261 is specifically for those relatively rare cases where there is an expected non-trivial difference in behavior between Python 2 and 3.  Using it for this case would mean hundreds of examples like

```
<type 'int'>  # py2
<class 'int'>  # py3
```

See?  It's silly when you look at it that way.
