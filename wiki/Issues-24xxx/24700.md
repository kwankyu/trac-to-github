This could should have crosslinks is_greedy() <-> is_supergreedy().

Currently documentation for is_greedy has a paragraph "Informally said...". I suggest adding similar to this, like

Informally said a linear extension is supergreedy if it “always goes up when possible and returns down as less as possible”.

I think one can write an informal description without reference to an article.

The codes seems to get stuck with

`for le in Poset({1: [2, 3], 4: []}).linear_extensions(): print (le, le.is_supergreedy())`

Please check with something like for P in Posets(): print(len([le for le in P.linear_extension() if le.is_supergreedy()]) or similar.
