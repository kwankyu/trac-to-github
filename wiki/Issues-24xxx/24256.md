In #24247, the implementation of `generic_power` was moved to a new module `sage.arith.power`. The old implementation should be deprecated. This is done in a separate ticket instead of #24247 because that ticket already does a lot.

I believe you are still missing one in `schemes/morphism.py`:

```
from sage.structure.element import (AdditiveGroupElement, RingElement,
        Element, generic_power, parent, coercion_model)
```
From the old patchbot reports, there are also some deprecation warnings popping up for NTL. The only plausible reason I can see from grepping is it is fixed by #5574.

Also, I don't understand why you did not make the change in `groups/generic.py`?

What is "the change"? I kept the `import` because some code might be importing `power` from that module. But it's the same `generic_power` function, so it's still deprecated (as indicated by the comment).
