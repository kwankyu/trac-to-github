there is also an error in poly.c, where a non-void function returns nothing.
This is trivially fixed by

As it was being fixed, more problems were uncovered, and then a pesky GC bug, that went away after adding an explicit `GC_INIT()` call.

It appears that all is fixed by https://github.com/miguelmarco/libhomfly/pull/11

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

the last remaining problem was the lack of `GC_INIT()` call in the library (something that is apparently not needed on Linux, but the docs
say that that some platforms might need it...)

With https://github.com/miguelmarco/libhomfly/pull/11
it is all fixed, also on the current Sage's GC version on OSX.
