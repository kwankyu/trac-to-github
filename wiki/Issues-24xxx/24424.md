The output of `one_solution` is random: 

```
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx", line 27, in sage.combinat.matrices.dancing_links
Failed example:
    sorted(x.one_solution(ncpus=8))
Expected:
    [0, 1]
Got:
    [2, 3]
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  20 in sage.combinat.matrices.dancing_links
    [175 tests, 1 failure, 8.38 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Also, does ncpus=8 really use 8 cores? We already parallelize doctests! Tests should definitely not x8 that.

I changed 8 to 2. The dancing links problem in question uses only 6 rows. So, it is not something that will use a lot of cpu time (something like 1ms).
