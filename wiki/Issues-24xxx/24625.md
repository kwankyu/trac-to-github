A few things:

- You should add tests for `_rmul_` and `_lmul_` for bad inputs and make sure they fail gracefully.
- The `revert_series` for arb, are those actual things that prevent you from finding such an `f` or is it just something you cannot currently handle?
- The generic `revert_series` `EXAMPLES` is missing a second colon `:`. You should also add a test the generic code (which it would be good to have a more explicit message).
- For both `revert_series`, you have a latex formatted `self`, which will look a little strange in the, e.g., html doc.

I thought the coercion system took care of that?

> - The `revert_series` for arb, are those actual things that prevent you from finding such an `f` or is it just something you cannot currently handle?

It depends what you mean by that. For example, the reversion of a power series of valuation 2 would be a Puiseux series.

I am not completely sure. I think it makes an attempt at executing the methods if they are defined. However, it never hurts to have a few tests. :)

So there is not a theoretical limitation on the result? (This is outside my mathematical knowledge, please bear with me.)

Fine :-)

Sorry if my answer was not clear. It *is* a limitation if we want the result to be a power series (which I'd say we do, in this context), but not if we allow for more general series expansions.
