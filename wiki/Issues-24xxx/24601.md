This one liner:

line([(0,0,0),(1,1,1)]).show(viewer="threejs")

does not display correctly in Chrome Version 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) Built on Ubuntu , running on Ubuntu 17.10 (64-bit) or the same version in Windows. Sage 8.0 and 8.2beta3 produce the same HTML, other than the location of the threejs code. Both don't display in Chrome.

It displays fine in firefox 58 under Ubuntu 17.10.

My javascript skills are pretty limited. I did step through the code in both browsers. I didn't see any obvious differences

I'll attach screen shots.

Paul, it is still an issue under Ubuntu 19.04 with 9.0beta3

With Chrome 76.0.3809.100. Viewers threejs and tachyon do NOT display numbers and ticks. Viewers canvas3d, jmol and wavefront work.

Under Firfox 70.0, only viewer threejs does not display tics and numbers.

Hello. I was able to replicate this bug on my Ubuntu machine in Chrome, and I've pushed a fix for review.

The z-component was left undefined when setting the text sprites' scales. I'm not sure why this bug didn't also appear in Firefox or on Windows. Particulars of the javascript engines with each browser/platform I suppose.

Best regards!
