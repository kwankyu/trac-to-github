I'm not either, now that you call it out.  I think this might have just been a placeholder for the correct implementation, but it definitely doesn't look correct as is.

I'd rather not. It's still only going to be a small change.  It does need more tests though.

"small" in which metric? Number of lines of code? Changing `__cmp__` to `__richcmp__` is a non-trivial change.

Ah,

```
return (self._ring == r._ring) == (op == Py_EQ)
```
I originally had *almost* this but with an `and` instead of an `==` but when I realized that was wrong I somehow overlooked this solution.

Some of the other changes are weird because I already had them in my local Python 3 branch.  Maybe I made them after I first opened this ticket.
