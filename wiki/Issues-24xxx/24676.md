Apparently, i moved file one directory lower for testing, and then i was confusing with `git rm`, thanks for noticing !

This patch does not apply and i did not find the corresponding lines in the current sources, so perhaps this is fixed upstream. It is a cygwin-related patch, so let me add Erik in copy.

I haven't explicitly tried it, but I don't think that patch is needed for Cygwin, which has sigsetjmp, etc.

I don't care much anyways since I'm making good progress on getting Sage to use more system packages by default, and while I haven't added readline yet it's an obvious high priority candidate.
