GAP 4.8.10 was released on 2018-01-15.

Release announcement:

Changelog:
* https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/changes/chap2.html#X7C4288E67EBB512B

From SageMath 7.6.beta3 to the current SageMath 8.2.beta3,
we use GAP 4.8.6, introduced in #20914. Time to upgrade!

Tarball for GAP:
* https://www.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap48/tar.bz2/gap4r8p10_2018_01_15-13_02.tar.bz2

Note that #22626 will upgrade to the upcoming GAP 4.9,
but it would be nice to upgrade to GAP 4.8.10 for now.

I suggest getting GAP 4.8.10 in Sage 8.2, if it's not too much work, since:

- GAP 4.9 might still be in beta when Sage 8.2 is released.
- GAP 4.9 has major changes, so #22626 (Upgrade to GAP 4.9) might take time.

Although the release of GAP 4.9.1 is approaching, I don't know if it will still be a beta
or considered the official 4.9 release.

It might still be possible to get GAP 4.8.10 in Sage 8.2. What are the steps to produce

Hard to know in advance, but one might hope that minor version bumps
in GAP would be relatively easy to deal with.

The upgrade to GAP 4.8.10 in the ArchLinux packaging of SageMath
seems pretty straightforward:

Thanks François for the info.

The branch as is is not yet functional, as libgap needs to be the same version as gap.
Sebastian's libgap above is missing the prefixing; he will work on this tonight, and then I'll update this branch and rerun the tests.
