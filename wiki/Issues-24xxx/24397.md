```
sage: f = function('f')
sage: f(1, 2)._convert(RR)
f(1.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000)
```
This loses information that might be needed by the function. Some functions might even require exact arguments for correct results.

This ticket tracks and doctests the Pynac fix.

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. Developers deny it's a bug.

We are scratching at the fundamental design decisions here.

The bug that sparked this ticket can be resolved differently anyway.

Is there a reference for the upstream bug report and discussion?
