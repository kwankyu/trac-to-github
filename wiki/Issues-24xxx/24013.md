to iterate over the terms of a polynomial from InfinitePolynomialRing, a method `p.terms()` is missing. Indeed, the method `monomials` does not include the coefficients:

```
sage: R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: p = x[0]+2*x[2]*x[3]              
sage: p.monomials()
[x_3*x_2, x_0]
```
The method `p.terms()` would return `[2*x_3*x_2, x_0]`.
