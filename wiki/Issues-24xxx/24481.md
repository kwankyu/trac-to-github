Upstream PARI has finally accepted the patch `stackwarn.patch` which has been in Sage since about 2 years. However, the version which was accepted upstream is not exactly the patch from Sage. In this ticket, we replace `stackwarn.patch` by the version which was accepted upstream.

I have no idea why... I just noticed failures on the Cygwin patchbot and not on others.

In any case, the current branch should be tested on Cygwin before positive review can be given.
