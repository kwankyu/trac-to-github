LGTM, but I agree with Jeroen that we should test this on Cygwin as that can be a bit more fickle about libraries and linking. I will try to get to this this week, but I may not be able to.

The patchbot should get to it soon I imagine.  In fact I'm surprised it hasn't already, since it's been running a bit more efficiently lately.

I think I will change its configuration so that tickets with "cygwin" in their keywords can be given higher priority.  In the meantime, if you change the ticket's priority (say to critical) it will also be weighted higher.
