Recent versions of curl, libcurl, and its headers are installed by Xcode on OS X, so we do not need to install it as part of Sage.

To test this branch: run `autoreconf` and then `make`.

```
checking for curl-config... /home/jdemeyer/sage/local/bin/curl-config
checking libcurl version ... 7.53.1
checking curl/curl.h usability... yes
checking curl/curl.h presence... yes
checking for curl/curl.h... yes
checking if libcurl is version 7 and >= 7.22.0... yes

So you should at least check the header `curl/curl.h` too.
