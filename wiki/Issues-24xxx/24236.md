In many cases it is not necessary to prove equality of expressions but just check structural identity. An undocumented trick for doing this is `(ex1-ex2).is_trivial_zero()`. This ticket implements a well visible member function for this task.

Thanks for implementing this!


A quick question: is this strictly equivalent to `(ex1-ex2).is_trivial_zero()`? I mean, can we have expressions `ex1` and `ex2` for which `(ex1-ex2).is_trivial_zero()` and `ex1.is_trivially_equal(ex2)` do not give the same result?

One case is:

```
sage: inf = SR(oo)
sage: inf-inf
...
RuntimeError: indeterminate expression: infinity - infinity encountered.
sage: inf.is_trivially_equal(inf)
True
```
When I tried to construct another I found a segfault:

```
sage: half = SR(QQbar(1/2))
sage: (half-1/2).is_trivial_zero()
True
sage: half.is_trivially_equal(1/2)
BOOM
```
which is fixed in the next commit. Nice question! It turns out this gives True as well.

Yes, it's a tree walk in C++ that returns as soon as a difference in the tree is seen.
