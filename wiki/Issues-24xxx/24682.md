This is a followup to #24045:

This is generalisation of Paley digraphs from #24045, due to A.Duval, [â€‹J.Comb.Th. 47(1988) pp. 71-100](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009731658890043X), nowadays called strongly regular digraph/tournament. We can use code in comment 14 of #24045, and Paley would be a subcase (in fact, this code will give you Paley if 4n-1 happens to be a prime power).

You assume the existence of a unique strongly regular digraph of order n. Is it the case ?

- `n+1` -> `n + 1`
- `f'Strongly regular digraph'` -> `'Strongly regular digraph'`

yes, it's the same for many other combinatorics and graphs constructions.
E.g. if you ask for a Hadamard matrix of order n you get the 1st found, or if you ask got a strongly regular graph with the given parameters you get the 1st founds, same for block designs, orthogonal arrays, etc.
