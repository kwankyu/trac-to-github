A nice one :

```
sage: [(t,t(x)._maxima_().exponentialize().demoivre().sage()) for t in [sin,cos,
....: tan,sinh,cosh,tanh]]

[(sin, sin(x)),
 (cos, cos(x)),
 (tan, sin(x)/cos(x)),
 (sinh, -1/2*e^(-x) + 1/2*e^x),
 (cosh, 1/2*e^(-x) + 1/2*e^x),
 (tanh, -(e^(-x) - e^x)/(e^(-x) + e^x))]
```

This is a Maxima problem :

```
(%i5) map(lambda([t],[t,demoivre(exponentialize(t(x)))]),[sin,cos,tan,sinh,cosh,tanh]);

(%o5) [[sin,sin(x)],[cos,cos(x)],[tan,sin(x)/cos(x)],[sinh,(%e^x-%e^-x)/2],
       [cosh,(%e^x+%e^-x)/2],[tanh,(%e^x-%e^-x)/(%e^x+%e^-x)]]
```

One also notes that `sin(x)/cos(x)` is not simplified in `tan(x)`.

The inclusion of #10038 (which implements a Sage solution) in 9.5.beta0 may be considered as solving this problem (that won't be fixed in Maxima...). I propose to close this ticket.

Advice ?
