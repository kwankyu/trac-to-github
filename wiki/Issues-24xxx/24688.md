Maybe you could do that over any number field, if possible ? using something like

```
A = self.base_ring()
emb = A.embeddings(RR)[0]
return -self.period_lattice(emb).complex_area().log() / 2

Is this really ready for review?
I'm a little confused as to what this is meant to do, is it meant to match Magma's FaltingsHeight? For example in Magma V2.22-6

```c
> E := EllipticCurve("32a");
> E;

quite different from the output this ticket gives, and the code in Magma is a lot more involved, picks a minimal model, uses the denominator of the j-invariant, discriminant etc.

The Magma documentation leaves a lot to be desired here I think.

I forgot the web calculator exists so I only checked it against MagmaV2.18-5. And in that version, the height was dependent on the model which was rather confusing to me. I always worked with the minimal model anyways so that difference didn't matter to me.

I'm happy to see that that has changed:

```
E := EllipticCurve("32a");
FaltingsHeight(E);
FaltingsHeight(WeierstrassModel(E));
```
yields

The only model-independent formula I know of requires computing the minimal discriminant anyways so it should be okay to just compute the minimal model, from a speed-perspective as well.

I think I'm being slow but I don't see how knowing the BSD invariants help with computing the Faltings height.
