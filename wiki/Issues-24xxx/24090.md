Remove the superfluous `__hash__` methods everywhere. Speed up the caching as `cdef` attribute.

Remove `_set_pivots` which is only used in one place.

Remove these comment blocks which are outdated and make it harder to `grep` for what you need:

```python
    #################################################################
    # LEVEL 1 functionality
    # * __cinit__
    # * __init__
    # * __dealloc__
    # * set_unsafe(self, size_t i, size_t j, x)
    # * get_unsafe(self, size_t i, size_t j)
    ################################################################
```
