The last line of the following snipped runs until a maximum recursion depth exception is raised:

```
R.<a> = QQ[]
QR = R.fraction_field()
S.<b> = QR[]
p = b+1
print p(1)
``` 

**Keywords:** polynomial, fractionfield, multivariate

The following line also loops:

```
p(R(1))
```

but this line works:

```
p(S(1))
```

So it's a coercion thing...
