When computing the points in the kernel set of the isogeny, it is unnecessary and slow to perform the computation of P.order(): slow because computing the order requires factoring the order of E in many cases, and unnecessary because the preceding code block checks that P has finite order, and in the finite order case we can just compute all multiples of P until we get the identity since we need to compute all of these points anyway in order to list the kernel set. For curves of cryptographic size and kernels of small order, we have measured that eliminating the P.order() computation makes the EllipticCurveIsogeny function run 200 times faster.

I (David) discussed this problem with William Stein and Kevin Lui at JMM 2017, and Kevin identified the source of the problem, but seems to have never checked in a fix.

I changed a few small things:

1) Fixed a line in doctest so that it works with sphnix.

2) Removed the multiples import and removed list.

Is there a smaller example? The current one take me about 75s

Sorry to bug you again. But is there a even smaller example? I think the doctests are suppose to take under a second. Alternatively, you can flag it as a long test.

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/doctesting.html#run-long-doctests

As a side question, how are you able to come up with these primes?

After this, it should be go to go. Can you set the ticket as 'need review'? and I can give it a positive review.

You just pick random exponents until the resulting p is a prime. What you want is:

* p is not too large (so that the test runs fast)
* factoring p+1 takes a long time (so that the test demonstrates the need for avoiding factoring p+1)

However, I'm worried that if p is too small then improvements in future factoring technology will render the second point false while still not invalidating the main conclusion that factoring is too slow and should be avoided in general. I think the lowest we should go is (180, 194). This runs in under 1 second on my machine.

The full test is then:

```
p = 12 * next_prime(2^180) * next_prime(2^194) - 1
F = FiniteField(p, proof=False)
E = EllipticCurve([F(1), F(0)])
P = E(0).division_points(3)[1]
EllipticCurveIsogeny(E, P)
```
