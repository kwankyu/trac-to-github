Old ticket description

This ticket organize the integration of flat surface code from several developers into Sage. The order of integration might roughly follows:
* #14683: new datastructure for iet
* #16159: quadratic strata
* #16102: Lyapunov exponents strata and their covering constructions
* #9806: constellations (ramified cover of the sphere from a topological/combinatorial point of view)
* #16018: conjugacy class iterator
* #16170: cardinality of Rauzy diagrams
* #16169: separatrix diagrams
* [Ronen Mukamel code](http://math.uchicago.edu/~ronen/software/triangulated_surface.tar.gz) (ticket coming)
* Vincent Delecroix code on origamis (ticket coming)

It can be closed as soon as all of the above code is integrated into Sage.
