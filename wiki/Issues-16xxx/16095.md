We have the following

```
sage: S.<Y,X> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, order='lex')
sage: f = 1/2 * X
sage: f
1/2*X
sage: f.parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in Y, X over Rational Field
sage: S
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in Y, X over Integer Ring
sage: f.parent().term_order()
Degree reverse lexicographic term order
sage: S.term_order()
Lexicographic term order
```

The term ordering should be preserved.
