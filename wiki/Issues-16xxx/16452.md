Helloooo everybody !

I read the introduction of this page a bit too verbose, given that the point of this page is only to index all of Sage's methods :

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/

What do you think ?

There is a general description of Sage which belongs to the website's main pages (not the reference's manual), and two big paragraphs about ... the first two entries of the reference manual.

We can make it much shorter, and respect the user's momentum by letting them dive immediately in the reference's manual instead of reading long sentences !

Add/Change whatever you want. English is not even my own language, so the sentences will probably not be as light as I intend them to be `:-)`
