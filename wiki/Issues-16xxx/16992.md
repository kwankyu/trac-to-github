Now that we are actually using a versions control system as it is intended, the `sage --fixdoctests` workflow is a bit antiquated:

* Run `sage --fixdoctests src/sage/foo.py`
* Get a diff printed to stdout
* copy `src/sage/foo.py.out` to `src/sage/foo.py`
* Run `git diff` to get the same diff again

Instead, just overwrite the file directly. Use version control for the rest.
