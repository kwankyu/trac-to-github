This was originally deprecated in #4102, I believe; if we give it a year, which seems the least one could do here, looks like sometime late summer 2014 should be a good time to do this.

Ah, #16737... sorry, I was looking at #16023 where it was originally proposed to remove these guys.  My apologies, 

I have to say it is annoying to have two different things all in that one ticket though.  Since you merged this branch into that one, I am going to prefer to review these changes here and those changes there.  It's not that huge of a patch, but it's still better to separate such development into little chunks, at least for my (slow) workflow.

And now you upgraded #16737 to 6.4.beta0 which I haven't built yet ;-) so it will take a little longer for that one.
