As reported by Samuel Neves on [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/ARJ3-5EFhrs), the following raises a PARI error due to an overflow in converting from `t_INT` to long:

```
p = previous_prime(2^64)
F.<x> = GF(p^2)
x * 2**63
```
The problem is that the conversion is done using PARI's `itos` (`t_INT` to signed long) instead of `itou` (`t_INT` to unsigned long).

Component: **finite rings**

Keywords: **pari overflow**
