Some trivial changes are done in the documentation of graphs. The file numerical/test.py is also removed, as it seems to be a legacy of a previous era. It does not even test Sage but scipy, it appears nowhere and is not properly indented. And if we keep things whenever we do not know what it is there for we will end up with a lot of useless code `:-P`

Hello Nathann,

I have rebased on 6.3.beta3, and things look good to me, but I do not understand why you remove completely the file src/sage/numerical/test.py

Could you please explain why, or repair that if this was a mistake ?

I don't think I did this by mistake (I had mostly forgotten this patch `:-P`) but really I don't know what to do with this file.

1) It does not appear in the doc
2) It contains nothing but a doctest (not properly indented. I just checked that it was actually doctested when you do `sage -t test.py` and apparently it does)
3) It does not seem to test Sage but scipy
4) All the modifications done to this file since the beginning are just people changing the output of the doctests when some updates are made, or Jeroen adding a "# long time" flag.

Here's what I think: this file has been added in 2007 and nobody knows what it does anymore. If we don't remove it it will just stay there forever, just because nobody knows what exactly it does. At the very least we should move its content to an existing file somewhere, but really I think we should remove it as nobody knows what exactly it does.

Ok. I **do not like** when a ticket for something is used for something else. It reminds me of the national assembly using a law about agriculture to change the prize of the stamps, or something like that.

Nevertheless, I suppose that in the current case, I can still give a positive review, **once** the ticket description contains a complete and precise list of what it does, and the title is also changed accordingly.
