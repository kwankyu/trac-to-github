Change ring for subschemes does not let the user specify an embedding and so fails for QQbar

```
K.<w>=QuadraticField(2)
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
X = P.subscheme(x-y)
X.change_ring(QQbar)
```

```
K.<w>=QuadraticField(2)
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
X = P.subscheme(x-y)
H = End(X)
f = H([6*x^2+2*x*y+16*y^2,-3*x^2-4*x*y-4*y^2])
f.change_ring(QQbar)
```

changing the try/except to has_coerce_map_from reduced the functionality. For example QQ to GF(3) does not have a coerce map from, but can be done.

Can't we just make sure that `base_change` or `change_ring` can also be given a ring homomorphism from the base ring, to base extend to the codomain of the homomorphism? Then

```
X=Scheme(Q,...)
k=GF(3)
Xk=X.base_change(k.convert_map_from(QQ))
```
would work (provided we don't check if the map really is a homomorphism).
Then we can have that `X.base_change(GF(3))` can still raise an error (because it's not well-defined), but we can still get an answer.

When this is not unique, you seem to be suggesting raising an error and having the user construct the particular map they want. It seemed more user friendly to me to simply choose one and provide a warning that happened.\n\nThe problem is that we don't have a channel to reliably report warnings through. If you print them in places where people aren't particularly looking for output, they are easily missed. In fact, STDOUT might be redirected to /dev/null, and messages on STDERR might be hard to match up with the rest of the data (if it gets read at all).\n\nTo quote the Zen of Python: \"In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\". I'm not for following the Zen religiously, but I think it's a good principle. In this case, I think the error is a more honest and ultimately more reliable solution than making some non-canonical guess.",

Replying to [@bhutz](#comment%3A11):
> The remaining issue was what to do if not specified. In this case, one is attempted to be constructed (the try/except parts...). When this is not unique, you seem to be suggesting raising an error and having the user construct the particular map they want. It seemed more user friendly to me to simply choose one and provide a warning that happened.

The problem is that we don't have a channel to reliably report warnings through. If you print them in places where people aren't particularly looking for output, they are easily missed. In fact, STDOUT might be redirected to /dev/null, and messages on STDERR might be hard to match up with the rest of the data (if it gets read at all).

To quote the Zen of Python: "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.". I'm not for following the Zen religiously, but I think it's a good principle. In this case, I think the error is a more honest and ultimately more reliable solution than making some non-canonical guess.

I understand the concern and definitely didn't want to silently guess, hence the verbose warning. However, there was some precedent since

```
K.<w>=CyclotomicField(3)
CC(w)
```
just works and 'guesses' what embedding to use.

However, if just raising an error is more in-line with similar other functionality, I can do that instead.
