# Issue 20512: 0 by 0 minor of a matrix should belong to the base ring

This shouldn't return an error:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(2, QQ)
sage: X = P.subscheme([])
sage: X.Jacobian_matrix() # This works
[]
sage: X.Jacobian() #This doesn't
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'reduce'
```
I think the mathematically correct answer is that X.Jacobian() should equal the ideal (1). This is consistent with the definition in the docstring:

```
  * the `d\times d` minors of the Jacobian matrix, where `d` is
    the :meth:`codimension` of the algebraic scheme, and

  * the defining polynomials of the algebraic scheme. Note that
    some authors do not include these in the definition of the
    Jacobian ideal. An example of a reference that does include
    the defining equations is [LazarsfeldJacobian].
```
In this case d=0, and the unique 0 by 0 minor of any matrix (empty or not) is equal to 1. And anyway, the Jacobian ideal of the full ambient space should cut out the empty subscheme.
