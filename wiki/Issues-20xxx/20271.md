Changing the presentation of fraction field elements breaks several algorithms. This issue was found while trying to normalize the presentation of these elements in #20246 (see [305c28e6](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/6550ba0b3ebdcfafca1299235f59bec8d0abc1b8)). Stopgap warnings should be added for all of them.

Depends on #20246
