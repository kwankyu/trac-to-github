as a step towards python3

there are currently in this file three occurences of 3/2 that are certainly not intended to be 1 (py2 value)

No -- but I did not test it, I only looked at the code changes.
Am I right in thinking that with the old code 3/2 rounded down to 0, while with the new Z(3)/2 is is an exact rational?  Or a float 1.5?  In all three places, a float would be sufficient, in case that is better.

3/2 was previously rounded to 1, and is now the rational 3/2.

I think everything will become a float at some point, but there should be no need to
do that too early.
