The recent changes to `sage-uncompress-spkg` have made it *a lot* slower than before. In particular uncompressing the GCC tarball takes 15 to 30 minutes. I haven't analysed in detail yet.

Okay, so propose a fix, perhaps on another ticket.

In the meantime, Sage builds from scratch on my OS X machine in a reasonable amount of time and passes all doctests.

PS I don't know the history of this file - it is really just to remove unintentional `.DS_STORE` files, some of which I know I inadvertently introduced at times?

The script though *silently* drops them; no warning, no error message.

Furthermore, there's absolutely no reason to sort the files by their names, then extracting them in their original order, not only but especially when there aren't any "OS-specific" files in the tarball (which is the common case -- as you said, there shouldn't be any in the first place).

While already the Python library's function name is "funny" (extract**all**()), it's not necessary to pass an *unmodified* list of all tarball entries to it in the "non-error" case.
