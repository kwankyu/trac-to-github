OK, these are good so I mark this as positive review. Some other notes:

Reference to Python 3 is old and misleading. It gives an impression that we are just waiting for a one package and then switch to Python 3.

Ticket #6375 is fixed, so is the question about sage-flags.txt still relevant?

Is the advice about runlevel 3 still relevant? How old systems we suppose "normal" users to use?

`nohup` thing should maybe be in another page with `timeout`, `ulimit` and so on.
