yes, I have seen this. This concerns debugging version of the program only, IMHO. My C++ is too rusty to get any idea what goes wrong there, besides vague recollections of "iterator traits" etc I got nightmares about... Hopefully it's OK as it is.

should 4ti2 be in frobby dependencies?

If I understand the manual correctly, 4ti2 is only used by the frobgrob script, which is currently not installed.
I think it should be installed; and 4ti2 should be a "recommended package" rather than a real dependency (like those many packages that one "should" install before polymake).
