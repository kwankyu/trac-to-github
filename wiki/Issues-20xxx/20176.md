Something like <code>:python:\`RuntimeError<library/exceptions.html#exceptions.RuntimeError>\`</code> should work for Python-links.

Changing `ellipsis marker (...)`  to <code>ellipsis marker \`\`...\`\`</code> would (IMHO) make it clearer what the actual marker is, since it is typeset as code (tt-font). What do you think?

Replying to [@dkrenn](#comment%3A10):
> Something like <code>:python:\`RuntimeError<library/exceptions.html#exceptions.RuntimeError>\`</code> should work for Python-links.

Nice tips. Thank you!
