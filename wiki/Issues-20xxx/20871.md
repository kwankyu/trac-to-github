Fixes 2 issues:

1. An outright bug following from #20721: If the files in a tarball are not all under a top-level directory (shouldn't be the case, but possible), the `-d` flag did not work as advertised.

2. Always unset setuid and setgid flags.  There's no reason they should be set in a source tarball (I don't think?) and it will mitigate issues like #20870

There is still an issue with zip files.

`sage -i bliss` gives:

> There is still an issue with zip files.

Was this reported before?

Might as well fix it as part of this ticket too while I'm fixing bugs.

It looks like the `ZipFile` class is inconsistent with the `TarFile` class, where `open` is a classmethod.  I think I knew that but forgot this time.

I didn't see a report; but zip files did work in the past. Perhaps introduced in #20721? I didn't catch it at this time.
