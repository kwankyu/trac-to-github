The documentation of the package modular/modform_hecketriangle contains some typos in the documentation and inconsistencies regarding the official [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) conventions. Here is the documentation of this package:

[https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modfrm_hecketriangle/index.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modfrm_hecketriangle/index.html)

Moreover, it would be desirable to add some reference and explain how to use the package more deeply. Indeed, the code here seems independent of the original modular forms implementation but use a different approach for its implementation.  Thus, it can be confusing to use for someone who is already familiar to the original implementation of modular forms (by "original implementation" I mean the one in modular/modform).

Therefore, the goal of this ticket is to review the documentation, fix the typos and add references. 

**Remark**: the package modform_hecketriangle was originally implemented in 2013 by Jonas Jermann (see the ticket #16134).

Hi David,

What is the reason for capitalization here

```
-Graded rings of modular forms for Hecke triangle groups
+Graded Rings of Modular Forms for Hecke Triangle Groups
---------------------------------------------------------
-Modular forms for Hecke triangle groups
+Modular Forms for Hecke Triangle Groups

I did that because most of the nouns in a title in english should be capitalized. Also, if you look at the reference manual, most of the titles follows this convention. The titles were not properly capitalized in this package, see:

> What is the reason for capitalization here

After some investigation, it turns out that the Python's guidelines for documentation is that section should not be in title case so commit 697f0b8 was a mistake from my part.
