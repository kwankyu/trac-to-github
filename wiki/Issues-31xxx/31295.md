`distutils` is marked deprecated in Python 3.10, 3.11 - see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0632/ and https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/distutils-legacy.html?, which also lists some replacements

Tickets:
- #30912 - switches sagelib `setup.py` from distutils to setuptools
- #30984 `sage_setup`: Replace imports from distutils by setuptools
- #31349 `sage.misc.cython`: Replace imports from distutils by setuptools
- #31335 homebrew: Unused packages (singular, pari, ...) in /usr/local leak into sagelib build via distutils.cfg -- configures `setuptools` to use its vendored distutils instead of stdlib distutils
- #32565 `sage.features.Executable`: Remove global imports from `distutils`
- #32873 `sage.features`, `sage_setup`: Replace use of `distutils.errors` by `setuptools`
- #33065 Remove use of `distutils.log`
- #33137 

Other issues:
- As we switch from distutils to setuptools for extension building, the tests for working distutils in `python3/spkg-configure.m4` are no longer meaningful

OK, I could have flagged pari_jupyter earlier, but I am more worried about packages sage_lib depends on. pari_jupyter not working is probably affecting a very small number of users and not an obstacle to sage itself. I guess in the back of my mind I see cysignals going out of maintenance since Jeroen disappeared. cypari has somewhat been rescued but could also be a concern.
