The function `potential_good_reduction` states that it returns a dynamical system with good reduction at a specified prime.

Currently, the following example returns a dynamical system:

```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
system = DynamicalSystem_projective([3^5*x^3 + x^2*y - 3^5*x*y^2 , -3^5*x^2*y + x*y^2 + 3^5*y^3])
system.potential_good_reduction(3)
```

However, it is proved in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.1201.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.1201.pdf) that this dynamical system does not have potential good reduction at 3.

Following the criterion in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.6695.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.6695.pdf), a fix is implemented by first checking the valuation of the resultant of the conjugate system before returning.

In order to be consistent, we change the function return type so that a tuple is returned in all cases.

Furthermore, we add an optional return conjugation parameter.

I took a look at this (finally) and it looks fine to me. If I'm understanding the references correctly, the conjugation you are producing must be the one that gives good reduction, so you check if the resulting map does, otherwise it does not.

Maybe this is not the place to discuss this, but I'm a little concerned about the fact that this function returns different types depending on the result.  I'd be a little inclined to change the returns to

True, dynamicalsystem

False, None

Although, why is there no option to return the conjugation? So perhaps as a second option

True, DS, PGL

False, None, None

That way the returns are always consistent.

Since this is not yet in a released version, we're still free to change such things without having to worry about deprecation.

Added the desired example.

I found an example which failed causing an embedding error:

```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
system = DynamicalSystem_projective([3*x^2 + x*y+y^2, 9*y^2])
prime = system.field_of_definition_periodic(1).prime_above(3)
system.potential_good_reduction(prime)
```

The most recent pushes fixes this and add it as a test. Some of the code I wrote to fix it, however, I am unhappy with.

Since the change ring on projective points doesn't let me pass an embedding, I tried to use the embedding by hand on line 7076. Check that line to see if I missed something there.

Also, I resorted to checking if an embedding is defined on line 7094. Is that good practice? I couldn't come up with another approach, as using the identity when embedding_preimage was not defined failed tests.
