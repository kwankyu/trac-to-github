Following up on #31377.

- #31049 `setup.py develop` rewrites the installed `sage-version.sh` as if it is a Python script
- #33627 Move `sage-gdb-commands` out of `src/bin`
- #32406 Make `./configure --enable-editable` the default
- progress report, how many files yet need to be compiled
- #34334 a version of `sage_setup.clean.clean_install_dir` for editable installs: remove .so and .pyc files that are leftovers from other branches
- Don't hardcode `nthreads=4` for cythonizing but use the one used by make and/or `SAGE_NUM_THREADS`. See also #33317.
- (from [#32406 comment:24](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32406#comment:24)): upon startup, automatically detect if it had to recompile because of a change to a Cython file and issue a warning
- #34209 Use PEP 660 editable wheels for sagelib
