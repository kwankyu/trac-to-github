For example, on macOS, there is the symlink `/var -> /private/var`, and so if `SAGE_LOCAL=/var/tmp/xyz`, the Python package when installing to the staging dir may resolve SAGE_LOCAL to the absolute physical pathname; but `sage-spkg` only copies from $(SAGE_DESTDIR)$(SAGE_LOCAL) and will miss the entire installation.

After #29585 (Remove DESTDIR staging for Python packages), this general defect no longer affects Python packages; but the issue may reappear if the build system of some other (non-Python) package decides to resolve pathnames to physical.
