```markdown
The pattern of importing setuptools before distutils was already used in other files, but not in sagelib's setup.py. This caused errors of the form "AttributeError: 'Extension' object has no attribute '_needs_stub'" on my machine.

I understand this install method is deprecated, but I believe this patch has essentially zero cost and can safely be added to Sage 9.3.
