Thank you for going through and doing some cleaning of this file. It definitely needs it. Overall, LGTM, but I do have a few questions and comments.

Why did you change this test?

```diff
-            sage: g.plot(color_by_label=True, edge_style='solid', layout='circular')
+            sage: g.plot(color_by_label=True, layout='circular')
```

You no longer need the `update` internal function:

```
        def update(key, label, color, head):
            edges_to_draw[key].append((label, color, head))
```

I personally find `a = (x, y)` easier to understand than `a = x, y`. However, this is more stylistic.

Also stylistic, but I would rather have the longer variable name `curr_loop_size` rather than `r` to have more self-documenting code.

Why did you create this variable?

```
p12 = (float(p2[0] - p1[0]), float(p2[1] - p1[1]))
```
It seems like it is only used to compute the perp slope. I feel like it doesn't add to the clarity.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A2):

Thanks for agreeing with that and for taking a thorough look.

> Why did you change this test?
> 
> ```diff
> -            sage: g.plot(color_by_label=True, edge_style='solid', layout='circular')
> +            sage: g.plot(color_by_label=True, layout='circular')
> ```

To simplify this test copied from Ask Sage in #31542, as:

- `edge_style` defaults to `'solid'`
- the test is for the number of edges, not their style

> You no longer need the `update` internal function:
> 
> ```
>         def update(key, label, color, head):
>             edges_to_draw[key].append((label, color, head))

I hesitated to remove it, but I agree the benefits
no longer clearly outweigh the drawbacks:

- pros: six lines 16 characters shorter, less brackets and parentheses.
- cons: overhead of an internal function

> I personally find `a = (x, y)` easier to understand
> than `a = x, y`. However, this is more stylistic.

I agree and I'll change that.

> Also stylistic, but I would rather have the longer variable name
> `curr_loop_size` rather than `r` to have more self-documenting code.

I agree and I'll change that.

> Why did you create this variable?
>

> ```
> It seems like it is only used to compute the perp slope.

I agree and I'll revert to the previous version.
