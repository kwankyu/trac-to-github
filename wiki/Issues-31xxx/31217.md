`subsemigroup` does not work for matrices; and even when the command does not fail, the answer could be wrong.

Let's try the subsemigroup generated by `A`, where

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: A = matrix([[0, 1], [0, 0]])
sage: A * A
[0 0]
[0 0]
```
Note that `A * A == 0` so the subsemigroup consists of `A` and `0`.

(1) First obvious attempt fails (this is how I expected it to work):

```
sage: M.subsemigroup([A])
...
TypeError: <class 'sage.sets.family.TrivialFamily_with_category'> is not hashable and does not implement _cache_key()
```
This error message is not helpful: after digging around a while, I figured out that the input gets converted to a `Family`, so after trying to specify a `Family` instead, I realized that the real problem is that `A` is not immutable.

(2) Second attempt fails:

```
sage: M.subsemigroup([M(A)])
...
TypeError: <class 'sage.sets.family.TrivialFamily_with_category'> is not hashable and does not implement _cache_key()
```
I thought this work work because I explicitly converted `A` to an element of `M`. It turns out that `M(A)` is not immutable, which seems like another issue that should be corrected.

```
sage: M(A).is_immutable()
False
```

(3) Third attempt: first create `A` as an immutable matrix.

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: A = matrix([[0, 1], [0, 0]], immutable=True)
sage: S = M.subsemigroup([A]); S
A subsemigroup of (Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring) with 1 generators
```
Here, the command does not fail, but the result is wrong:

```
sage: S.list()     # fails first time, but not the second time...
...
TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable
sage: S.list()
[[0 1]
 [0 0]]
sage: [A, A*A]     # this is what the answer should be
[
[0 1]  [0 0]
[0 0], [0 0]
]
```
