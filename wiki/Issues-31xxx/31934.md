This is confusing:

```
sage: for E in J0(37).decomposition(): print(E.rank())
2
2
```

since the two E's in here -- as modular abelian varieties -- have Mordell-Weil ranks 0 and 1.

The problem is that the "rank" method is getting inherited from somewhere (modular symbols, modules?).   It would be better to just raise an error than do the above.

Component: **modular forms**
