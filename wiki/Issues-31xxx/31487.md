Here's a minimal example:

```
ambient = VectorSpace(GF(2), 3)
subspace = ambient.subspace([[1,1,1], [0,0,1]])
subspace_complement = subspace.complement()
subspace + subspace_complement == ambient    # This returns False!
```

Of course, by definition, a subspace and its complement should always sum to the ambient space. Note that this also fails silently.

Component: **linear algebra**
