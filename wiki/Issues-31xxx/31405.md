1) Apparently, schlegel_projection works only for 4d to 3d. Or also for 3d to 2d? (That would be nice to have.) 5d to 4d? Please mention

2) There is no such thing as a "stereographic projection" of a polytope. Stereographic projection is a mapping between a sphere and a hyperplane.
What this really is is just a *central projection*, from some point. (like the Schlegel diagram as well, except that the projection center is constrained). Where is the image hyperplane? Probably perpendicular to the vector from 0 to the projection center? Can that point be 0? Does the projection plane go through the origin, or does it touch the unit ball?
What happens if the point lies inside the unit ball?

3) Is there no parallel projection? (or special case orthogonal projection) Or is it in some other 
module?
