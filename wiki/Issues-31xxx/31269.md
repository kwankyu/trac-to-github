We propose the introduction of a protocol (ie a specified method with a standardized name) on finite ordered sets in order to access the hash of elements of an ordered set as a [Python array](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html). This kind of feature is needed in some situations to implement efficient hashing of composed objects such as permutations encountered in eg #31236.

Note that for "big" finite sets this makes no sense (storing the array would be memory prohibitive). However, as far as symmetric group as concerned, the list of elements of the domain is done anyway.

Component: **performance**
