Hi, newbie here.
This ticket is created per suggestion in the following conversion:
https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/hcYi4jxIN8c/m/XdHVL3DGAAAJ

In the conversion, I observe that the speed of
`Matrix(GL(2^8, GF(2^8)).random_element()).is_invertible()`
is too slow comparing to a rather straightforward strategy
--- checking the rank against the matrix size
`A.nrows() == A.ncols() == A.rank()`.

Travis then suggest to implement `is_invertible()`
in the class `Matrix_gf2e_dense`.
I also want to add that, at least over finite fields,
the rref approach feels to be faster, because
1. there are asymptotically faster algorithm for rref; and
2. `False` can be returned as early as a pivot is found missing.

Component: **linear algebra**
