sage: A = matrix.identity(QQ, 4)                                                
sage: A._subdivisions                                                           
sage: A2 = A.change_ring(RDF)                                                     
sage: A2._subdivisions                                                          
( [ 0, 4 ], [ 0, 4 ] )
```
We should also disregard when being passed no subdivisions:

```
sage: A = matrix.identity(QQ, 4)
sage: A._subdivisions
sage: A.subdivide(A.subdivisions())
sage: A._subdivisions
( [ 0, 4 ], [ 0, 4 ] )
```
