<div id="comment:0"></div>

We define a simple general interface for setting a simplex basis.

The naming of the methods `is_variable_nonbasic_at_lower_bound` suggests that at some point it will be extended by `is_variable_nonbasic_at_upper_bound`. 

So the design of `set_basis` will take this possibility into account.
