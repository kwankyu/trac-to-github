The "releases" page on GitHub:

- https://github.com/sagemath/sage/releases/

has 9.4 from 2021-05-09 20:35 UTC
and 9.3 from 2021-05-09 22:00 UTC, differing only by that.

Once the new version was out as 9.4, I would have let it be:
luckily it had slipped up and not down.

I wonder if any robots are going to have picked it up and cause trouble.

Should we skip the 9.4 version number now and call 9.5 the next cycle?

OK, done. 

I've also manually added `9.3` to the 9.3 release title - this is needed so that it's marked as `latest` by GH. I also had to do this for 9.2. 

Volker, is it something in your release scripts that needs fixing?

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A11):
> What do you mean by release title?
> 
> I don't push to github directly, there is a script somewhere that syncs trac -> github

GH releases have a tag and a title.
Releases without a title are somehow considered drafts.
We normally set title to be the same as the tag, but this is something that script has to do.
