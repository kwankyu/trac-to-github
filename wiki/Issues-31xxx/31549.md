I can take a look at this change, but it probably won't be until next week.

just a quick comment. The commit message should be short (one line) with the more detailed description in a following paragraph.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

On the surface this functionality works, but the details need a little work.

In the code itself there are a number of white space issues. For example

```
[(1/t)*x^2 + y^2  ,y^2])
```
should be

```
[(1/t)*x^2 + y^2, y^2])
```

In the new if line as well, you're missing a space after the comma and have an extra space before the closing ).

The example code should be improved in a number of ways:

- I'd suggest saving a line and removing K and just defining the function field over the finite field directly.
- The variables base and CF are not used so should not be in the example.
- D is not needed: P is already the domain of DS.
- Instead of calling normalize, just define the dynamical system as you want it to be defined as.

While adding support for function fields, seems like you should also allow finite fields, since that also requires no other changes.

There is a doctest failure. Looks like you might need to use "sorted" for that doctest.

Also, why did you not also allow finite fields as requested?

The whitespace issues were fixed in the example, but the example no longer is a true function field example as the function and all the points are over the base field. The example should use the function field variable 't'.
