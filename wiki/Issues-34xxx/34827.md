We add the following types of vector partitions:

1. Vector partitions with distinct parts.
2. Vector partitions with parts from a given set.
3. Vector partitions where certain parts are allowed to repeat while others are not.

Component: **combinatorics**

Keywords: **Vector Partitions, distinct parts**
