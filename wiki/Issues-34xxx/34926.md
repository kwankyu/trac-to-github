Looks fairly trivial. Is this the only issue with 1.9.0-35? I have been on leave and working remotely which took it of my radar.

Actually 1.9.0-35 is totally unusable (without patching) since it ships a broken function declaration in a header. This seems to be fixed in 1.9.0-37, and there are no further issues as far as Sage is concerned.

As a side note, I've had to patch it since a few releases ago to make it build with `-Werror=format-security` but this doesn't affect Sage (which doesn't set this flag).
