<this was first reported on the sage-devel google group:
https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/s0B7OqpB0KU/m/18eHSiRWAAAJ ;
as requested I'm opening this ticket>

I am running into an issue with computing isogeny classes of elliptic curves over number fields.

Here is what I entered:

```
K.<a> = QuadraticField(4569)
myJ = 46969655/32768
E = EllipticCurve(j=K(myJ))
C = E.isogeny_class()
```

This raises a `KeyError` in the first instance, which seems to be handled via a direct call to `IsogenyClass_EC_NumberField`, but this then raises a `ValueError: Cannot convert infinity or NaN to Sage Integer`. See the above linked discussion for the full stacktrace.

This error has occurred on sage-9.4 on a system whose `uname -a` is `Linux LEGENDRE 5.4.0-91-generic #102-Ubuntu SMP Fri Nov 5 16:31:28 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`, as well as on sage-9.7-beta5 on `Linux Barinder 5.4.0-121-generic #137-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 15 13:33:07 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`.

Changing the field K to many other quadratic fields does not yield any error. However I did also notice this error with many j-invariants in `QuadraticField(6537)`, so it somehow seems to be base-field dependent.

Two issues are fixed in this ticket: (1) computing the isogeny class could fail for a curve defined by a non-integral model; (2) precision was not handled well in scaling equations by units.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I'm sure it's because the fundamental unit is very skew:

```
sage: u, = K.units()
sage: embs = K.embeddings(RealField(100))
sage: [e(u) for e in embs]
[-3.9113242967798985503709688068e34, -16384.000000000000000000000000]
```
and the fix will likely involve increasing precision at some point.

As a work around, which I would recommend anyway for curves with rational j-invariant:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(4569)
sage: myJ = 46969655/32768
sage: E = EllipticCurve(j=myJ)
sage: EK = E.change_ring(K)
sage: C = EK.isogeny_class(minimal_models=False)
```

It should be possible to do `E.isogeny_class(minimal_models=False)` with E as you defined it, but this raises a different error.  I'll fix that one too.

The `KeyError` observed is harmless, when you ask for the isogeny class it first checks to see if it already has it, and only computes it if not.

For the second issue, line 1523-6 of `gal_reps_number_field` in the function `reducible_primes_Billerey` are

```
    K = E.base_field()
    DK = K.discriminant()
    ED = E.discriminant().norm()
    B0 = ZZ(6*DK*ED).prime_divisors()  # TODO: only works if discriminant is integral
```
and the last line can raise an error when `E` is not an integral model.  I intend to avoid this by making sure that the various Billerey bound functions (which I wrote) are only called on integral models. [done, testing.]

The first (main) issue is in `ell_number_field` in the method `_scale_by_units()`.  There's a line in there

```
        prec = 1000  # lower precision works badly!
```
which is revealing.  The example reported here is clearly one where 1000 is not enough.  The lazy way out is to double that, but clearly it is better either to try to work out a suitable precision, or to wrap this in a loop which steadily increases the precision.  Or something.

Thanks for looking into this John -- I'll try the workaround you suggested above to get my code working entirely in Sage. (My previous workaround was to use `ellisomat` in PARI/GP; this is related to this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08891, whose results we're currently expanding to many other quadratic fields, including `QuadraticField(4569)`.)
