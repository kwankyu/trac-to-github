There is a design decision for `SignedPermutations` I do not understand: it inherits from `ColoredPermutations`, but the colors are `{+1, -1}` instead of `IntegerModRing(2)`.

In fact, also `IntegerModRing` looks strange to me, because we really only consider the colors as a group, not a ring.

It seems to me that the only reason for this is the result of `SignedPermutation.colors()`.  However, this choice requires us to implement very many methods twice.

I see a few possibilities:

1. keep the decision and ignore its downsides
2. introduce a group containing two elements `{1, -1}`.
3. only override `SignedPermutation.colors()`.
4. change the colors to `{0, 1}`.
