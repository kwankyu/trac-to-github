The task of computing the matrix by which an isogeny acts on a particular nâ€‘torsion subgroup often comes up in algorithms for supersingular elliptic curves. (In particular, it appears as a subroutine of computing the kernel of an endomorphism-ring ideal.)

This patch adds a simple method to compute such a matrix, based on `AdditiveAbelianGroupWrapper.discrete_log()`.

(The dependency is only necessary for the reference in the "see also" block.)

Depends on #34718
