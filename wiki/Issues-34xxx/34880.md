The `reverse=True` flag is recommended (and set by default) for quaternion orders, but I think it is also the better choice for all other quaternion lattices: Among other things, setting `reverse=True` makes the returned basis contain the norm of an ideal (very usefully generalizing the fact that the returned basis for an order contains `1`).
