`PositiveBasis` seems like a terrible name to put in the global namespace. Perhaps make `IntegerValuedPolynomialRing` a constructor that takes a keyword for selecting the basis?

Yes, I agree. It should be better to use a standard mechanism for "algebras with several bases". This mechanism exists and is used in several places but I do not master this for the moment.

Travis, would you know and tell me what I should do exactly in this direction ?

There are 2 ways to deal with multiple bases:

1. All bases are "equally good." Here, you would use the `WithRealizations` framework. See, e.g., the `DescentAlgebra` or many of the CHAs.

2. One basis is more special than the others. So the main global hook goes into that basis, and then you have methods that construct other bases. This is how I would model, e.g., Schubert polynomials as a basis for the polynomial ring.

To me, it seems like (2) is the situation here.
