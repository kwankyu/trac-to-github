There is already `greedy_linear_extensions_iterator` and `supergreedy_linear_extensions_iterator` in `hasse_diagram.py`. Might be nice to have a wrapper function for them in the finite posets class.

Should these be 1) two new functions, 2) one new function, or 3) addition to current `linear_extensions()` function?

I'll CC Frédéric, as he might have ideas about this. The function can be just oneliner, so one possibility is to just forget this. However, it may be little hard for a beginner to use `_hasse_diagram` directly. OTOH a class for special subset of linear extensions seems unnecessary.
