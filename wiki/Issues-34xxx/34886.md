I like this. A few questions:

- is it possible to reduce the code duplication between `fundamental_group` and `universal_cover_map`?

- can you provide more documentation for `PresentationComplex`, in particular a definition of what the complex is?

I wonder whether this would work for "graphs with constant link" - the complex with be given by vertices, edges, and triangles of a graph; one famous in graph theory examples are "locally Petersen graphs"; e.g. the 21-vertex graph with vertices being pairs of elements of a 7-element set, two vertices adjacent if the corr. pairs don't intersect. In Sage one can get it as
`graphs.JohnsonGraph(7,2).complement()`

In this case there is a universal 3-fold cover - corresponding to a subgroup of the Schur multiplier of the alternative group Alt(7), which is an automorphism group of this graph.

I'm still confused as to how one applies this functionality, e.g. getting the universal cover, to a simplicial complex, e.g.

```
sage: c=graphs.JohnsonGraph(7,2).complement().clique_complex(); c
Simplicial complex with 21 vertices and 105 facets
sage: c.fundamental_group()
Finitely presented group < e2 | e2^3 >
```
and then??? OK, one can do

```
sage: from sage.topology.simplicial_set import SimplicialSet
sage: sc=SimplicialSet(c); sc
Simplicial set with 231 non-degenerate simplices
```
but `sc` still does not know anything about its universal cover.

```
sage: based_sc = sc.set_base_point(sc.n_cells(0)[0])
sage: based_sc.universal_cover()
Simplicial set with 693 non-degenerate simplices

Ah, i see, sorry for that. We use it often with this meaning: a way to respresent a group in another one (usually easier to handle).

To me, a cover is defined by a subgroup H of the fundamental group F - each orbit of H on k-simplices of the universal cover gives one k-simplex in the cover you are constructing.
Unless you want to restrict to normal subgroups H of F, I don't see what epimorphism you mean.
And I don't see what dictionary is doing.

You get isomorphic fundamental groups as long as you pick base points within the same path-connected component, but different components can certainly have different fundamental groups. So it seems safest (and mathematically most correct) to force the user to explicitly specify a basepoint: force the user to work in the category of pointed simplicial sets.
