There is no difference between `autodoc`s of sphinx 5.2.3 and 5.3.0.

Thanks.

> Since you are now familiar with the code, 

Well.., it was basically trial-and-errors with bits of understanding here and there :)

> can you maybe list the major changes of sage's autodoc in #30893 with a proposal for how to remove the modification.

I marked in the code where modifications are made. It is easy to list them:

1. skipping lazy imports to avoid deprecation warnings
2. providing argspecs for decorators (sage_wraps)
3. dealing with nested classes
4. dealing with cached function(methods) callers
5. dealing with classcall metaclass  
6. dealing with class aliases
7. using argspecs instead of signature 

but sorry no proposal for how to remove them. All looks difficult. I am not sure if the aim of eventual removal of sage_autodoc is really achievable. 

After #26254 merged, switching to signature seems the most urgent thing.
