... as it does not make sense as a subcategory of `Sets`

Instead if multisets are needed anywhere, they should go through the `values()` or `items()` methods of `EnumeratedFamilies` (#34340).

For enumerated sets of non-hashable elements, we need to provide (slow) methods for cardinality, containment, etc. that use comparisons only (see #23324).


Depends on #34340
