For what it's worth, I was unable to get Ubuntu's 22.04 python3.11 (they still ship 3.11.0) accepted by configure as good python to use.

But maybe 3.11.0 is broken.

oops, I see. Never mind, a container-related confusion.

By the way, is there documentation on Sage "packages" on [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub), incorporated in Sage developer docs? (i.e. docker containers with pre-built Sage stuff which one can pull and then update, for quick testing?)
