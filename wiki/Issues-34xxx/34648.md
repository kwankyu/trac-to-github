Adding
- a transition guide from Trac (based on https://github.com/sagemath/sage/wiki/migration-from-trac-to-Git**b)
- links to GH command-line interface, e.g., https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_fork

As of this ticket (for Sage 9.8, assuming it can be released in January 2023), we would keep the Trac instructions. In a follow-up ticket (for Sage 9.9), we will remove them.

I don't have the capability to lead the work for this ticket, but can help from a side as time (not much in January) permits.

It seems there are two things to do here. To build the workflow first and write it down for developers. But it seems to me that the workflow is not clear yet. It is not clear to me. I need to educate myself first to even start helping writing it down.

So instead of thinking in the air, we may need a sample project to experiment and experience how to do what we have been doing in trac, now in github. Thus I suggest to work on this ticket not here, but in the github repository https://github.com/sagemath/trac-to-github, regarding it as the "trac" in github. So we start using the issue template or PR template, and build the workflow there while working on updating the developer guide. 

Let's start by opening an issue in the repository for this ticket.

Okay. Then the draft in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/wiki/migration-from-trac-to-Git**b would suffice?

> I just want to make sure that the developer's guide in the upcoming release already acknowledges the transition to github.

Then would it be just an announcement pointing to the draft of the workflow?

But I think by the time of the scheduled transition to github in February, more solid form of the workflow should be in place. So the upddated developer guide should be provided (or at least ready) at the same time. Perhaps this is for another ticket

Anyway I think we need a playground to consolidate the workflow before the transition, though the final form would (and could) be settled after the transition.

By the way, I find this article interesting:

https://jtway.co/convert-github-issue-to-pull-request-c624834835d8

which solves the main difference between github vs trac workflows.

I don't see the button, perhaps because of permission. Anyway I guess it creates a new PR. The point is, I think, that a issue is converted to a PR so that they have the same number.

I have just moved the transition guide from the sage github wiki to https://github.com/sagemath/trac-to-github/blob/master/docs/Migration-Trac-to-Github.md (because the description how things such as milestones are mapped from Trac to Github should be updated at the same time as we make changes to the migration script).
