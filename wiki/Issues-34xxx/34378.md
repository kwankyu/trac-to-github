As reported at
https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/issues/565

we currently have

```
sage: r.eval('cat("Hello, world!\n")')
Hello, world!
'<rpy2.rinterface_lib.sexp.NULLType object at 0x7ff05713c680> [RTYPES.NILSXP]'
```
and similar situation occurs for other cases where the last R command returns NULL. In Python such return values are not shown explicitly and it would be nice to catch them for R as well.
