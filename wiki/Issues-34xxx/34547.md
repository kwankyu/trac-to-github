<div id="comment:0"></div>

Various files in `sage/interfaces/` have this pattern:

```
class Octave(...):
    ....

octave = Octave()
```
When combined with `from .octave import Octave, octave` in `sage/interfaces/all.py`, this means that an instance of `Octave` is created when Sage starts up. I think we should avoid this with lazy imports.


Depends on #16522

Where do the ".all" namespaces actually get used and for what? Are they just to trigger initialization of modules? Or do people use them to access symbols too? They certainly be *importing* symbols from them. Especially with lazy imports, that leads to undesirable side-effects (see e.g. #16522):

```
sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima is maxima_calculus  # they are the same object
True
sage: maxima_calculus(1)
1
sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
<class 'sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.MaximaLib'>
```

`sage.interfaces` is a namespace package, so we're getting rid of imports from `sage.interfaces.all` within the Sage library, see #34201. When this is done, all that will remain is the reimport into `sage.all`, to fill the interactive top level as the only purpose.

> `sage.interfaces` is a namespace package, so we're getting rid of imports from `sage.interfaces.all` within the Sage library, see #34201. When this is done, all that will remain is the reimport into `sage.all`, to fill the interactive top level as the only purpose.

Ah, OK, so our current infrastructure actually guarantees that `LazyImport`s in `sage.all` end up broken in the toplevel. Possible fixes would be to build the global namespace piecemeal and recreate appropriate `LazyImport` objects rather than just referencing them, or just do the copy and then clean them up with something like `clean_namespace` (see #16522). The latter is much easier to implement. It looks like cleaning `sage.all` and the toplevel namespace upon construction would give us a lot of benefit for relatively low effort.

One reason to ensure `LazyImport` shims don't stay lying around, especially at top level, is that documentation is only partially transparently reported. Compare:

```
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima? # reports doc but with wrong type, signature, and source file
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima? # second time is OK
```

versus

```
sage: maxima_calculus? # never gets type, signature, and source file right
```

Note:

```
sage: maxima_calculus?? # finds source but is still missing type and signature
```

Apologies, indeed, the "*_console" objects are just functions that, in the terminal, just starts a fresh process; as far as I can see simply as a "subshell": it just executes "os.system(cmd)". I think it's very rare current usage of sage would use that and it's easily replicated by other means, so I'd expect the "*_console" routines can just go.

In fact, as it stands, they are not available in my global namespace! So somehow:

```
try:
    from sage.repl.rich_output.display_manager import get_display_manager as _get_display_manager
except ImportError:
    pass
else:
    if _get_display_manager().is_in_terminal():
        [BLOCK]
```
must have led to not executing [BLOCK], even though on the IPython command line `is_in_terminal` does return true and the import succeeds as well. Perhaps during initialization one of these things works differently?

My concern was for the interface objects themselves (the "magma" and "octave" instances): those are not just functions. They're actually instances of a quite complicated class. 
They're obviously written to be quite light-weight (only initializing the expect interface if they're called) so you may want to do some timings to see if making them lazy actually saves anything measurable.

Replying to [John Palmieri](#comment%3A36):
> The right place for these `*_console` imports is perhaps in `sage.all_cmdline`

I think that's a good solution. 

I don't think we need to be concerned about use of these functions in user code that would try to import them from sage.interfaces.all.

More issues: I have no idea why, but removing these lines from interfaces.all break the emacs sage-shell-mode:

```
-interfaces = ['gap', 'gap3', 'giac', 'gp', 'mathematica', 'gnuplot', \
-              'kash', 'magma', 'macaulay2', 'maple', 'maxima', \
-              'mathematica', 'mwrank', 'octave', 'r', \
-              'singular', 'sage0', 'sage']
```
If I restore this, or if I just add a line `interfaces = []`, then it seems to work again. I am not going to open a ticket for this right now, in part because I'm busy with other things and in part because I have no idea what's going on.

I thought that this might be related to `repl.interface_magic`, since that's a place that imports `all` from sage.interfaces.all, but I can't see why. However, the code in that file tries to register the various interfaces to create IPython magic commands like `%%gap`, and with the various new lazy imports, those interfaces are no longer registered.

Do we care? Is it worth restoring these?

This variable is not used anywhere in the Sage library, as far as I can tell. I see three options:
1. restore it just as it was before
2. restore it and set it to a sensible value, probably asking the sage-shell people what that means
3. let the sage-shell people set it in their own code to a sensible value

1 is easiest. 2 makes more sense than 1, and 3 makes more sense than 2, at least to me. Unless we think that other people were also using this variable?
