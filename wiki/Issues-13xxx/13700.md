DynkinDiagram().an_instance() returns something that isn't a Dynkin diagram, in the sense that it is non-crystallographic, i.e., its Cartan matrix is not symmetrizable.  

```
sage: X=DynkinDiagram().an_instance()
sage: X.cartan_matrix()
[ 2 -1 -1]
[-2  2 -1]
[-1 -1  2]
sage: X.cartan_matrix().is_symmetrizable()
False
```

It will be trivial to fix this.  

I wonder if the "add_edge()" method should be changed -- as it stands, it is easy for the user to create instances of DynkinDiagram() which will not in fact be Dynkin diagrams, as this example shows.

I don't exactly know why I got worked up enough about this to open a ticket.  

My usage (which I think is typical of people in representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras) is that Dynkin diagrams are of types A to G.  

Maybe the thing that bugged me is that if you ask for an instance of a Dynkin diagram, I feel like you should get a typical instance.  I feel like C_3 would be a better choice.  

But I don't have a clear sense of how questions like this are resolved in Sage.

I think the result is mathematically correct. But I see the point of returning something more typical. This is the outcome of the tension between the two use cases of this method:
- Providing something typical / well known for the user
- Providing something generic enough, in particular for running tests.

If I checked correctly, this method is barely used. So we don't have to worry about backward compatibility. Here is a suggestion:

```
    sage: DynkinDiagram_class.an_instance()
    ... returns a Dynkin diagram of type C3 ...

    sage: DynkinDiagram_class.an_instance(finite=False)
    ... returns the current output ...
```

Any variant for the name of the argument is welcome. 

For the Dynkin diagram of type C3, we have two options: either return DynkinDiagram(["C",3]), or build by hand the same Dynkin diagram (again for a bit more genericity). I don't have an opinion on this.

Cheers,

I have no opinion about the right way to implement a feature which would give example(s) of Dynkin diagrams.
