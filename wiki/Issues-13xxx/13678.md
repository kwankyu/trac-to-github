I like it!  Works as advertised.  I'll run tests shortly.  In the meantime, a suggestion and a question.

(1) Stripping out "matrix" from the name of the method is a nice touch, but then the docstring appears (to the novice) to be talking about a slightly diffferent command than the one queried.  Having ready access to constructors is the first step in experimenting with Sage, then tab-completion takes over for methods on that object.  So tab-completion to discover constructors is fabulous.  But it should be as totally straightforward as possible, IMHO.

What do you think of putting "matrix" back in the method names of the matrix object?  Yes, it is verbose and redundant.  It does not seem to complicate tab-completion (ie, you do not need to use tab any more in either scenario).  And in the Sage library, authors can use the "old" method names without involving the matrix object (and I would think this would be preferable).


(2) Is there anyway to make the `func_*` methods on this object invisible on tab-completion?  I have no real good idea if they are useful, or just detritus.  It'd be great if `matrix.<tab>` **only** showed the constructors.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A5):
> I agree that it would be better if `matrix.foo` were then mentioned in the docstring of `foo_matrix`, feel free to fix this.

If it is easy to inject something like "matrix.foo() is equivalent to foo_matrix()," could this be added?

It drives me nuts when we define an alias for some method and it is not included in the docstring of the original.  I'd put this in the same category, so if a one-time hunk of code takes care of it, then I'd love to see that happen.  Just trying to keep an eye out for the newcomers and minimize unnecessary confusion when there are two ways to do things.

Gee, it seems like it would be nice to generalize the decorator one more level, so I could do something like:

```
@namespace('matrix')
def vandermonde(R, v):
    return matrix(R, len(v), lambda i,j: v[i]^j)

```

I could see this being useful for other situations like this too.

Thanks for the review. 

I think it'd be worth mentioning matrix.[tab] in HLA, if it's not to late to slip in a note (and this actually goes in in time). 

FWIW, sagenb pull request at https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/125
