Excuse me, I would be interested in watching this source as I need a converter from Latex or MathML to Sage for a degree thesis I'm writing for the University of Torino (Italy). What does your previous comment signify ? Isn't any source indeed or can you associate me to this so that I can git-trac on it ?
Thanks a lot, best regards.

Davide
