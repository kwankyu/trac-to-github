We should normally have:
* The BishopGraph([d1,d2],radius=r) is isomorphic to the graph obtained merging the edges of the KnightGraphs([d1,d2],one=i,two=i) for 1<= i <= r.
* The QueenGraph([d1,d2],radius=r) is isomorphic to the graph obtained merging the edges of a RookGraph([d1,d2,radius=r) and a BishopGraph([d1,d2],radius=r)

With current implementation, the result was sometimes incorrect. This patch solves this issue and adds necessary doctests.

I was about to say that you should replace `if not B.is_isomorphic(H)` by `if B != H`, but...

```
sage: %timeit B == H
5 loops, best of 3: 199 ms per loop
sage: %timeit B.is_isomorphic(H)
25 loops, best of 3: 16.3 ms per loop
```

Honestly ...`>_<`
