If you take the quotient ring of a quotient ring, I would expect there to be a coercion map corresponding to the natural surjection. However this does not occur:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: S = R.quotient_ring(x^2+y^2)
sage: S
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x^2 + y^2)
sage: S.has_coerce_map_from(R)
True
sage: T = S.quotient_ring(x^3 - y)
sage: T
Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (-x*y^2 - y, x^2 + y^2)
sage: T.has_coerce_map_from(R)
True
sage: T.has_coerce_map_from(S) # this should be true
False
```

I suspect the following does not occur either (and is where the problem lies). If an ideal `I` is contained in an ideal `J`, there is not a coercion from `R/I -> R/J`.
