The patch here implements

```
sage --docbuild file=/path/to/foo.py TYPE
```
where `TYPE` may be any of the standard documentation types (e.g., html or pdf). This lets you build the docs for a file inside or outside the Sage library. It doesn't work for .sage or .pyx files right now, only .py files.

Hi there,

The option does not appear within `sage -docbuild --help` but it should!

Another minor question: it is a bit annoying that the resulting file belongs to `$HOME/.sage/docbuild/output/$NAME_OF_THE_FILE/output/html`. Is it possible to do otherwise?

This is a really amazing gadget!

Vincent

I just discovered this gadget. Yeah! Finally! I have been dreaming of this for a while. Indeed, I write my course notes and work sheets in ReST, and my workflow to convert them to html is, err, painful.

I am just missing one feature: having it work on .rst files as well. Would it be hard?

Thanks!

You could check out the documentation for `sage -sws2rst` where it tells how to convert the rst files to actual documentation using Sphinx; maybe that will give you an idea of how to do it easily with this (it's been a while since I looked at it).
