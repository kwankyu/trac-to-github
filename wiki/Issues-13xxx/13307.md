GAP will compute the automorphism group of permutation group.  This should be constructed as a collection of permutation group homomorphisms (there is already a Sage class for these).

This could be generalized in two ways:

1.  Looks like new versions of GAP implement an `AllHomomorphisms` command, so a group homset built from this would be a possibility.  See #13211
2.  Expand the applicability of this to more than permutation groups (though I have not checked carefully to see how many different types of groups GAP can do this for).
