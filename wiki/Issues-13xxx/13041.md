Implement a basic (but better than nothing) conversion of elements of number fields embedded into the complex numbers to elements of `QQbar`.

Origininal report:

```
sage: C.<z> = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: a = 2*z^2 + 5*z^4
sage: E = C.algebraic_closure()
sage: E(a)

Unfortunately, at the moment, elements of number fields don't coerce/convert to the algebraic closure QQbar.  This is an instance of #12715 (Number field embeddings should go via AA and QQbar).

Note that you can coerce elements to numerical complex numbers though:

```
sage: C.<z> = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: CC(z)
0.623489801858734 + 0.781831482468030*I
sage: QQbar(z)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<your snip>
TypeError: Illegal initializer for algebraic number
```

I would therefore suggest to mark this ticket as a duplicate.  (I don't immediately see a way to do that myself, so please let me know if I could and should have done so myself.)

I agree that this should be solved by #5355/#12715, but #5355 has been open for seven years now... The attached branch provides a temporary fix that at least makes the most common use case work, and shouldn't be hard to remove once a proper solution is in place.

For example:

```
sage: C.<z> = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: a = 2*z^2 + 5*z^4
sage: CIF(a)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexIntervalFieldElement
sage: CIF(CLF(a))

```

> Is there a related ticket?

I don't know. I needed to convert number field elements to algebraic numbers in experimental code of mine, so I wrote a small patch to make that work in the cases I was interested in, but I didn't try to go to the source of the problem...

Yes, the patch is far from perfect. Even so, I think it is an improvement (and I don't have much time to work on a cleaner fix right now), but if you disagree, I'll just keep my local patch for now!
