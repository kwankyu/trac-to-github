Currently, the Dedekind eta function is expanded by multiplying out its defining truncated product.  With the attached patch, Euler's identity is used instead for a significant increase in speed.

Before:

```
sage: %timeit qexp_eta(ZZ[['q']],10)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.41 ms per loop
sage: %timeit qexp_eta(ZZ[['q']],100)
25 loops, best of 3: 21.4 ms per loop
sage: %timeit qexp_eta(ZZ[['q']],1000)
5 loops, best of 3: 937 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: %timeit qexp_eta(ZZ[['q']],10)
625 loops, best of 3: 155 µs per loop
sage: %timeit qexp_eta(ZZ[['q']],100)
625 loops, best of 3: 221 µs per loop
sage: %timeit qexp_eta(ZZ[['q']],1000)
625 loops, best of 3: 873 µs per loop
```

* Maybe you could use

assert prec>0, "prec must be a positive integer"

instead of the ValueError that you have written

* You have to change the "n" into "prec" also in the OUTPUT block

* Maybe you could remove the comment "we pass this as an argument as .." in the INPUT block, which does not seem to be very useful.
