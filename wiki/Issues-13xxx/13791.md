Patch looks good again.

Oh, this has nothing to do with the patch, but while reading (again) the "conventions for coding in SAGE" document, I noted that we explicitly deviate from the PEP-257 by saying : "if you are defining a class, you might put a long informative docstring after the class definition, not for the `__init__` method".
