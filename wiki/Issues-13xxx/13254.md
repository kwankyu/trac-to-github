one comment : the last part of fundamental_group, where you use many nested tests to distinguish cases, does not look good and is hard to read. Maybe rather do something like

```
z = dict()
for i in range(3):
    if bdry[i] in spanning_tree:
        z[i] = FG.one()
    else:
        z[i] = FG.gen(gens_dict[bdry[i]])
```
and then

```
rels.append(z[0]*z[1].inverse()*z[2])
```
