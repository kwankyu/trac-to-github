sage/structure/parent_old.pxd defines:

```
cdef class Parent(parent.Parent):
    ...
    # Comparison of parent objects
    cdef _richcmp(left, right, int op)
```
But sage.structure.parent_base.ParentWithBase overrides it:

```
cdef class ParentWithBase(parent_old.Parent):
    ...
    def _richcmp(left, right, int op):
        check_old_coerce(left)
        return (<parent_old.Parent>left)._richcmp(right, op) # the cdef method
```

The result is a warning when compiling sage.structure.parent_base.

Does that need fixing? I am not sure. Also I am not sure about the bug component. Perhaps "build", because the only "problem" seems to be a warning while building sage?
