Currently when constructing an elliptic curve from a j-invariant over QQ,  a curve with minimal conductor is created (the so-called "minimal twist").  This could be expensive since it involves factoring j and j-1728, so an option to *not* find the minimal twist should be allowed, with the current behaviour as default for backwards compatibility.

For example:

```
sage: EllipticCurve(j=2^256+1)
```
currently triggers factorization of `F_8` (which is quite quick) but also `F_8-1728` (which is not).

Apply [attachment:trac13100-elliptic-rebased.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13100/trac13100-elliptic-rebased.patch).

 I removed trailing whitespace on lines I edited (or nearby) but not on the whole file as that makes it harder for reviewers to see what has changed.  Of course I could go back and remove the rest.  Does patchbot tell us what tests actually fail?

The patchbot will tell you if you click on the yellow disc (or whatever other color it might be), then click on "shortlog."

I ran the tests on my own machine and am not getting the same failure patchbot is.  Since I have no idea why your changes would cause a problem in sage.misc.trace, I'm going to give it a positive review.
