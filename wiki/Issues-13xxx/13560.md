The patchbot is hoarding patches, it seems impossible to make him not apply a patch that occurs somewhere in the ticket. For example, see #12533. The final result of that ticket is just a single patch but the patchbot still wants to apply old patches.

In the case where the ticket description explicitly says "apply <file.patch>" I think the patchbot should simply ignore all comments and further attached patches.
