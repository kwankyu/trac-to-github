See this [ask.sagemath thread](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2066/fonts-in-graph-graph-theory-pictures-are-type-3).

The default matplotlib behavior is to use Type-3 fonts in graphics. However, some (many?) publications have a strict stipulation of using Type-1 fonts only in the document. The method to force matplotlib to have this behavior is to add a matplotlibrc file in the working directory with the following contents:

```
rcParams['ps.useafm'] = True
rcParams['pdf.use14corefonts'] = True
rcParams['text.usetex'] = True
```

This tidbit should be added to the main graphics documentation in some nice way. A `..note` maybe?

Component: **documentation**
