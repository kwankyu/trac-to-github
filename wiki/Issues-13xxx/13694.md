The current implementation of `__getitem__` for a `LinearCode` element tries to generate the whole list of codewords and then returns the element needed. This makes it impossible to work with this since for linear codes of large dimensions, the generation of all the codewords is not only unnecessary, but it also eats up several gigabytes of memory.

The attached patch implements `__getitem__` for a linear code.

I think the the long comment in the code body should be basically put into docstrings, so that it also seen in the documentation.
This would also make it clearer in which order the words are coming. I'd give it positive review then.

It's a neat trick, to use p-adics!

with your fix, one gets fake elements, i.e. a stopping condition is missing:

```
sage: C             
Linear code of length 7, dimension 4 over Finite Field of size 2
sage: C[7]
(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
sage: C[77]
(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0)
sage: C[777]
(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0)
sage: C[7777]
(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1)
```

Shouldn't it throw `IndexError`? At least this is the old behaviour.
