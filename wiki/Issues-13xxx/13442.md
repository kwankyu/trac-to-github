Currently, to add gcd functionality for a new polynomial ring, one needs to add a specialized subclass of `PolynomialElement`.

The attached patch allows rings to provide a `_gcd_univariate_polynomial` method which will be called by `PolynomialElement` to compute gcds.

This is similar to #10635.

Depends on #13441

Is this part of some style recommendation?  I would say referring to `self` in the docstring is perfectly acceptable, since there is an object called `self` and it is usually clear what kind of object it is.  Personally, I strongly prefer `self` over constructions like "this element".

I agree with [#comment:5 pbruin] on `self` versus `this polynomial`. I find the documentation clearer with `self`, and this seems to be more consistent with the rest of Sage. 

Tell me what do you think of this, I'll positive review the ticket then. All tests passed with the current commits.

Both approaches have their drawbacks. `self` makes it harder to read if you do not know about python, i.e., if a 'user' consults the help. 'this polynomial' makes things slightly more difficult to understand if you know about `self`.
I have been asked on different tickets to replace `self` with something more appropriate. Sage is not really consistent with this.

I do not really care how we do this in sage. Either way is fine with me.
