**Attachment:** [13886-gcc-optional.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13886/13886-gcc-optional.patch)

Unfortunately, https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13533/13533_gcc_not_optional.patch does a lot more than remove "optional - gcc", so this isn't just a rollback.

So, Jeroen changed his mind?

Or will he be happy because of #13540?  (I.e., because those previously optional doctests will then automagically get run -- without having to pass additional parameters to `sage -t ...` -- provided the necessary parts, here GCC, are present and functional?)

P.S.:  Just realized #13540 is already in the dependencies; found it by reading #13533 ... :-)

Well, then try testing Sage with some "broken" GCC (e.g. `exit 1` in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc`) to see which ones fail, of course *without* #13540.  One may have to incrementally add `# optional - gcc` tags to get all of them (and leave out those that are just caused by previous failures)...
