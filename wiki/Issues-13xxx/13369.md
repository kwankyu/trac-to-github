This was done because trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs.patch no longer applies after recent changes to 10538, although it really was only this four line conflict.

* More substantially, trac_13369-cluster-seed-gm.patch fixes compatibility issues with recent changes to 10538 and 10527.  One can now apply all patches in 10527 in order, then all patches in 10538 in order, then the *two patches*

trac_13369-cluster_seed-cs-NEW.patch followed by trac_13369-cluster_seed-gm.patch,

and then the rebuilt sage passes all doc tests and appears to work correctly.

* A more substantial review will be forthcoming.

Hi,

I updated my first patch (and uploaded Gregg's patch without changes). This resulted in some missing doctests which I then added in yet another patch. We also had some old things in the ClusterVariable class which I removed. If we need that back later, we can do it in another ticket...

Cheers, Christian
