On Cygwin, PARI produces not only a shared library dll file but also an import dll.a file.
Nonetheless, the dll.a is not copied by the install targets of the Makefile.

And having it would ensure that other shared libraries linked with -lpari would link to libpari.dll rather than libpari.a (and some as eclib won't work with libpari.a anyway, see #13325), because ld looks in order for dll.a, then a, then dll.

This has been included upstream, see git rev 2c34d58be7f844581733e7c2b96f2a60ee3eb82a and ffd02415dde8a48f7c06765635b0457b23ba60e8
