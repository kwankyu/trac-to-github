Currently, computing the determinant, minimum polynomial, characteristic polynomial, etc of sparse matrices over the integers and finite fields switch them to a dense representation, then runs the dense algorithm.

This works, but is quite suboptimal. Linbox packs a few algorithms tailored for sparse matrices, e.g. iterative methods for the determinant, minpoly, etc. These methods have the advantage that they only read the matrix, and are memory efficient.

The aim of this ticket is to make these algorithms available in Sage.

Examples of things that are presently bad (where a sparse matrix is converted to a dense representation) : 

* kernel, determinant of sparse integers matrices 
* rank of integers matrices relies on echelonization, which very likely switch it to dense. Linbox has other ways of dealing with this.
* elementary divisors and smith form of sparse integer matrices (idem).
