Sage's python looks into my .local on start up: if I have 

```
~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
```

it would read from there and goes mad both: during [Installtion](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1427/error-compiling-50-scipy-09p1) and during [usage](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1449/sage-uses-system-wide-python) - despite the fact that


```
import sys
print sys.path
```

does not contain `~/.local` at all.
