It would be good to have a method to compute the automorphism group of a simplicial complex.

This patch implements that.

And also a procedure to check wether two simplicial complexes are isomorphic

It would be good to have a method to compute the automorphism group of a simplicial complex.

This patch implements that.

And also a procedure to check wether two simplicial complexes are isomorphic.

Well, it looks good to me again. The first dictionary in the doctests should not be a problem as the hash function of an integer is the integer itself, and the other tests are now isomorphism tests, returning True/False.

Sooooooooo I guess it's good to go again !
