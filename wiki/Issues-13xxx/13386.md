We correct

```
sage: import numpy
sage: numpy.int32(123) == 123
True
sage: 123 == numpy.int32(123)
False
```

The change causes numpy to be loaded on startup. It may be hard to not do it as there are many integer comparisons on startup (see [see nbruin comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/13386#no3)).

Component: **basic arithmetic**

Keywords: **integer, numpy, comparison**

I just added a patch, which avoids the loading of numpy during startup.

Unfortunately comparison with numpy types fail for all rings:


```
sage: import numpy
sage: QQ(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: QQbar(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: AA(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: RR(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: RDF(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
sage: RIF(1) == numpy.int32(1)
False
```

Hello,

I propose to close this as duplicate since #18076 fixes the issue

```
sage: import numpy
sage: 123 == numpy.int32(123)
True
