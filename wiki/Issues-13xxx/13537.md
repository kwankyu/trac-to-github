**Attachment:** [trac_13537.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13537/trac_13537.patch)

Instead of adding a second stopgap warning to the `_xgcd` method of `Polynomial_padic_field_dense`, I removed it entirely. It is a protected method, with no doctest which is not called anywhere in sage:

```
sage: search_src("Polynomial_padic_field_dense")
rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.py:777:class Polynomial_padic_field_dense(Polynomial_padic_generic_dense, Polynomial_generic_dense_field):
rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.py:796:class Polynomial_padic_field_lazy_dense(Polynomial_padic_field_dense):

sage: search_src("Polynomial_padic_field_lazy_dense")
rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.py:787:class Polynomial_padic_field_lazy_dense(Polynomial_padic_field_dense):

Does this really have to be a sage-5.4 blocker?

I followed the developer's guide: "Stopgap tickets should be marked as blockers." Should I have changed the version?
