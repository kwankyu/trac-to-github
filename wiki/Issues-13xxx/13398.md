A finite ring R is said to be a chain ring, if its set of left ideals form a chain.

This class of rings is very important in coding theory since it contains
finite fields, integer residue rings of prime power order and Galois rings.

This is a first attempt to implement these rings. Furthermore this patch provides a class 
FiniteRing_base
which stores the arithmetic of finite rings in tables.
