It would be nice if face/normal fans could be constructed from a generic (QQ-)polytope and not just from a lattice polytope:

```

sage: f=x*R.random_element()+y*R.random_element()+z*R.random_element()

`NormalFan` takes a lattice polytope as argument, not any QQ-polytope:

```
sage: NormalFan(Q.lattice_polytope())
Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
```
Having said that, it would be nice if any polytope would work.
