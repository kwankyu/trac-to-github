The `lrslib` and `lidia` optional package improve `latte_int` capabilities, but they need to be installed when `latte_int` get compiled. Through it is not strictly necessary to compile `latte_int`, i propose to add it as a (build-time) dependency.

`lrslib` can be used by using `count --compute-vertex-cones=lrs` (this is also exposed as a keyword argument of `ehrhart_polynomial`).

`lidia` matters for `count --irrational-primal --maxdet=1000` (these are also exposed as keyword arguments).
