Because most of the time, writing either a `_cmp_` or a `__cmp__` implies a call to `cmp`..

By the way, Jeroen, could you have a look at #22881, please ?

and maybe also to #22875, if you feel like..

I don't really follow this reasoning. It's obviously true that `cmp()` should be avoided because that doesn't work in Python 3. But just because some (or even most) implementations of `_cmp_()` call `cmp()`, that doesn't mean that `_cmp_()` should be avoided in general.

If you really want to say that `cmp()` should be avoided, then just say that instead of something else.
