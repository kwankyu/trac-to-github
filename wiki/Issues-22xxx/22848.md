Minor enhancements for Coxeter groups and Root systems:

* [x] Add categories/complex_reflection_or_generalized_coxeter_groups to the documentation
* [x] Move bruhat_graph from WeylGroups to the CoxeterGroups category and if the group is finite, allow bruhat_graph() to return the entire graph
* [x] Added the permutahedron function from the ReflectionGroup to CoxeterMatrixGroup
* [x] Update documentation for root_system/plot
