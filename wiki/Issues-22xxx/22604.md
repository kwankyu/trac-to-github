It all started a very long time ago as a fork of the Sphinx autodoc. Many changes have been made, some upstream changes were merged. It's not meaningful to say that it is a fork of a single upstream commit, it's much messier than that.

When I created this ticket, Sage was using Sphinx 1.5.3 so I guess it's best to compare against that: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/v1.5.3/sphinx/ext/autodoc.py
