Try this (on 7.5.beta4):

```python
sage: solve(x^3 == -8, x)
[x == I*sqrt(3)*(-1)^(1/3) - (-1)^(1/3), x == -I*sqrt(3)*(-1)^(1/3) - (-1)^(1/3), x == 2*(-1)^(1/3)]
```

The first solution is in fact `-2`. Looks horrible that way.

Sympy handles this well:

```python
>>> solve(Eq(x**3, -8))
[-2, 1 - sqrt(3)*I, 1 + sqrt(3)*I]
```

Wolfram Alpha is also ok with this.
