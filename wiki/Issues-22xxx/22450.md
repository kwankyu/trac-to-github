I started to improve the docker instructions and found that some things are actually wrong in our README. I made quite a few changes. I think it now looks much more appealing on github.

* make it generally more appealing on github.com by fixing markdown errors (trailing spaces, wrong indent, some use of `>`, more backticks).
* make all links use `https://`
* use more [clickable](https://inline.links)
* link to our download pages for binaries/sources
* remove link to non-existing errata page
* drop OSX parts for OSX versions where development is not supported accourding to the readme.
* we distribute Sage sources as a tar.gz, fix instructions to reflect that
* fix spelling of Xcode (not XCode)
* added a section about docker images
* fix some outdated file/directory names

I don't think these instructions should contain anything resembling instructions for installing Docker, beyond a link directly to the Docker documentation, as that is often in flux and not something Sage's documentation can/should keep up with.

The documentation for the container itself is outdated too.  The most up to date documentation is at: https://github.com/sagemath/docker-images#containers-for-sagemath--friends

the parenthetical about SSL is distracting and confusing, especially to a newbie ("what is an SSL library?  Does my system even have that? Why does that matter for math software?")  I would make that a note further done at the most.

Also I'm not sure if the answer after installing from a binary is to run `./sage`.  I'm not sure how all the different binary installers for Sage work but who's to say `sage` is in the current directory?

Sage without pip support feels somewhat like firefox without support
for plugins. With the general aim of a more modular Sage in mind, we
want to encourage people to distribute code as pip packages. However,
at this stage most users actually can't install them, due to misc
technical issues, the lack of SSL support being a big one
(first hand experience speaking here, with one occurence
no later than yesterday).

The whole SSL issue is complicated. Here is not the location to fix
it. Yet, if there is an opportunity to improve the README to increase
the chances that, in the easy cases, source installs will support SSL
with the default installation instructions, that would be a big plus.

Note by the way that there is a bias; a user that takes the time to
install from source presumably wants to do more than a few trivial
calculations.

Thanks!

I decided to make a followup ticket #25206 for the Windows stuff, since upon investigation I found additional place(s) in the Sage documentation that should be updated concerning Windows.

Volker, if there is going to be another release candidate it would be nice to include this (documentation only) change since it much improves our top-level README, especially for viewing on GitHub/Gitlab.
