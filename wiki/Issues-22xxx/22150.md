Before

```
sage: QQ[2^(1/3)].coerce_embedding()
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
  To:   Real Lazy Field
  Defn: a -> 1.259921049894873?
```
After

```
sage: QQ[2^(1/3)].coerce_embedding()
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 - 2
  To:   Algebraic Real Field
  Defn: a -> 1.259921049894873?
```

Component: **number fields**

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A9):
> The branch is not either. I think that #23117 was actually a bad idea. Coercion should not go through the real lazy field.

I agree that complex embeddings should go to `QQbar` or something like that by default, but for me this is a separate issue, already tracked elsewhere.

However, having the `K[α]` syntax create the “standard” embedding makes more sense to me (less confusing, probably breaks fewer existing things) than having it attempt to embed the number field in `α`'s parent or something like that—if that's what you have in mind.
