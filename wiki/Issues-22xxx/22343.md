This ticket is part 1 of 2.  When running Larsen's algorithm over fields of degree 5 or more, E.reducible_primes() takes for ever for at least two reasons: (1) computation of the Galois closure; (2) arithmetic over that closure.  I have an improvement which avoids working in the closure at all, using instead some polynomial utilities based on resultants.

On this ticket I will add the polynomial utilities and the improved version of the function `_supersingular_reducible_primes`.

On a second ticket I will add an implementation of a different method, due to Bilieray, for finding the reducible primes.
