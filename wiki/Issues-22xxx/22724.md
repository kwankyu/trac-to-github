polymake has a simple implementation of the dual simplex method, which works with polymake's quadratic extensions. 

It appears to be much faster than our `InteractiveLPbackend`. It is unknown (because no benchmarking has been done) how much of the speed differential is due to `InteractiveLP` latexing all intermediate tableaux.

We should make it available as a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` backend. (Of course, there are no integer variables.)

This could be based directly on
- #22452: Create a polymake pexpect interface
or use
- #22683: backend_polymake for Polyhedron

See also: #22710: Meta-ticket: polymake

Depends on #22452

**Keywords:** polymake, lp
