The optional package `modular_decomposition` either renders Sage broken,
or gives a lot of wrong results.

Downgrading it to experimental would at least give more warnings
to potential users.

It gives wrong results on many inputs. Moreover it is abandoned by the original upstream author(s).
See e.g. [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/Iha5__c_h44/cMrV6D6u1igJ).
The [latest](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/p7j1uZlmGII/w8Gj9WH1CAAJ) example. 

There is also a stopgap, and I think #17950 should have made it experimental already.

PS. There is no implementation available to hook up (neither Java nor Perl
implementations are useful for us). Would make a good student/GSoC project, I suppose...

Personally, I think the stopgap is a sufficient solution. But I'm not against the downgrade to experimental.

Let me just check if it still builds properly...
