Here's a workaround that deals with the issue without running code at the setup.py module level.  It's related, somewhat, to #21682, which should now depend on this.

Personally, I am really against pushing this to 7.5.

The current 7.5.rc1 is working fine, I would not want to risk to break stuff again. Especially build-system issues might take a while to be discovered.

I also don't see the urgency for this ticket. I agree that something needs to be done, but surely it can wait for Sage 7.6?
