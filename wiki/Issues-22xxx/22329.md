In #20086, 

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: (x**2)**(1/2)
x
sage: R(1)**(1/2)
1
```
was implemented.

However, this does not work in multivariate polynomial rings:

```
sage: R.<x, y> = ZZ[]
sage: (x**2)**(1/2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: non-integral exponents not supported
sage: R(1)**(1/2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: non-integral exponents not supported
```
#20666 is the general case (non-uniform behavior of powers for polynomials); this ticket shall handle the multivariate case.
