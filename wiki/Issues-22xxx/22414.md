```
sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing('n^ZZ', QQ, default_prec=3)
sage: n
n
sage: _.subs(n=1/(2-1/n))
1/2 + 1/4*n^(-1) + 1/8*n^(-2) + O(n^(-3))
sage: _.subs(n=1/(2-1/n))
O(1)
```
is wrong (the two substitutions are equal to the identity).

Similarly,

```
sage: n.subs(n=1/(2-1/n))
1/2 + 1/4*n^(-1) + 1/8*n^(-2) + O(n^(-3))
sage: _.subs(n=A(1/2))
O(1)
```

Aim: add a check `1/f` is `o(1)` to `.subs(n=f)`.
