It's a standard package, so it will be built. It just won't be used by anything.

Is it really problematic?
Remember that at the moment we ship GIAC which is completely broken outside x86*...

You can still modify spkg-check to disable testing on non-x86* if you want.

You mean, just like a compiler ;)

It is true that at the moment we are borked out on ppc64 and arm64 so it doesn't matter so much I guess.
