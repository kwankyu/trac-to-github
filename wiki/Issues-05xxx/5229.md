Also, and perhaps that merits a new ticket, the orientation of the axis is not what one would expect.

Normally 3d plots are shown with the positive x axis to the viewer's left, the positive y axis to the right, and the positive z upwards. Currently it is: negative y axis to the left, positive x to the right, and positive z upwards.
