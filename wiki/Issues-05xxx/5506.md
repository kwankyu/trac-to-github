We really should make symbolic vectors a subclass of the generic free modules.  That way we can have a .args() function, a variables function, and a few other functions that make sense for symbolic vectors, but maybe not for arbitrary vectors.

We can also make them callable, so vector-valued functions work.

#8947 is a start on this.  We could add to that an args() function, a variables function, etc.
