A couple remarks:

* the spkg is missing an hg repo. Please check in everything but src
* SPKG.txt does not conform to the standard - see the SpkgTemplate in the wiki 
* spkg-install needs to be executable
* spkg-check is missing, when you add it please run `make check` with it
* for the make check target: create foo.expected and direct the result from test foo into foo.result. Then diff, i.e. do not create the expected result in the script
* the makefile should have a make install target
* the makefile still uses `gcc -O3 -static` - this should be set via CC and CFLAGS for example

Not all of the above have to be fixed to get a positive review from me, but it would be nice to get those all fixed. The missing hg repo and an updated SPKG.txt should *really* be done.

Cheers,

Michael

This spkg is enough of an improvement to warrant a positive review. Much remains to be done, but this can be addressed via subsequent spkgs.
