Follow-up from #29534:

 By specially named tags, a developer could also request a specific set of tests to be run. Perhaps a suffix `/ci/cygwin`, `/ci/fedora`, `/ci/debian,fedora/TARGETS=pynormaliz/`... (This idea needs to be fleshed out. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26382234/what-names-are-valid-git-tags)
