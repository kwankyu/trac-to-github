Replying to [@dcoudert](#comment%3A4):
> #29309 also implements the same algorithm. Shouldn't you join forces to obtain a stronger implementation ?

Hi, The definitions of diameter used by me and
#29309 are different. He has made simplifications to his code based on the standard definition of diameter (like making direct calls to 

```
simple_BFS()
```
which returns diameter infinity for non strongly connected graphs. \\ \\

My implementation considers the max finite eccentricty, as specified in https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20086-6_5 \\ Which returns a finite diameter for both connected and unconnected graphs  \\ \\
His implementation would be a much better choice if we want to keep the definition of diameter the same for all algorithms. \\ \\
On the other hand, I can also modify my implementation to allow the user to set a parameter to make a choice on which definition of diameter they want to use. I would only need to add 1-2 lines of code to my current implementation to do that.
