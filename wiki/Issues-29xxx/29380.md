This is to fix an installation problem on Debian.

The upstream tarball URL is in checksums.ini. To test the update on this branch: Use `make SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -o" e_antic`; this will download the new upstream package automatically.

Works for me on debian buster. I force reinstalled normaliz after upgrading to e_antic 0.1.5 and all doctests with `pynormaliz` passed.

I don't get what `upstream_url` does. It doesn't work automatically for me. I still have to manually download the file into upstream.

Did you pass SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -o" to `make` as noted in the ticket description?

What do we need to give this ticket positive review?

I personally can test this only at ubuntu and debian. If you want, I can test it with your github workflow as well.
