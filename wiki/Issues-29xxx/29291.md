Follow up from #27705.

As openssl has been a standard package since Sage 9.3, there is no more point in accepting system python3 without ssl support or ignoring errors in building the ssl module when building the python3 spkg.

As SSL issues are no longer a likely diagnosis for failures with launching the notebook, we change the corresponding code in `src/bin/sage-notebook`. (Prompted by https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/IXypXTbVkDM/m/CsWl8HbZAwAJ)

Right, I'm not aware of a distribution whose python would be missing the ssl module. The new configuration tests here on the ticket protect against broken pythons compiled by users.
