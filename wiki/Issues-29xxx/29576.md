The patch revives search page. 

For this, I had to turn off Thebe (see changes in `layout.html`), which seems to conflict with `underline.js`. Actually it seems old Thebe javascript file is to blame, as with the latest one from CDN works fine with the search page.

I am not sure if Thebe still works with Sage. See related #24593. If we cannot turn off Thebe, then please provide updated javascript (here or to #24593).
