<div id="comment:0"></div>

The unconditional removal of backslashes leads to incorrect display of docstrings, for example:

```
sage: BinaryTree.to_full?
...
      sage: ascii_art(bt.to_full())
           __o___
          /
        _o_       o
       /
      o     o
           /
          o   o
...
```

The correct docstring should contain:

```
                 __o___
                /      \
              _o_       o
             /   \
            o     o
                 / \
                o   o
```

This affects both the command line and the jupyter notebook.

A consequence of the change on this ticket is that unknown latex macros such as `\leftarrow` are rendered as is and are not converted to `leftarrow` anymore.

I just want to mention that Julia has a quite extensive list of [latex-unicode mappings](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/v1.4.0-rc2/stdlib/REPL/src/latex_symbols.jl) that could be used for that purpose. The IPython latex tab-completion is based on that, but is limited to valid Python identifiers.
