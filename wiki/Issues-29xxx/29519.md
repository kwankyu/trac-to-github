Running Sage commands relying on the 'tides' optional package
results in an error message that confuses new users. See e.g.

- https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/a4vZQY4aajk/discussion

It would be nice to display a more informative error message.

Soon most standard packages will be kind of optional too (#29705), so regardless of whether we make this package standard, the error handling should be improved (using `FeatureNotPresentError`).
