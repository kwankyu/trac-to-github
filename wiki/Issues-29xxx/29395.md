#29104 added information to Sage what homebrew packages are available (see files named `homebrew.txt` in the subdirectories of `build/pkgs/`).

If you want to help with homebrew packaging of Sage, that's great; the starting point would be Sage packages that have a `spkg-configure.m4` but no `homebrew.txt`.

<div id="comment:7" align="right">comment:7</div>

It has been possible to install the SageMath macOS app
via a Homebrew "cask" for a while:

```bash
brew cask install sagemath
```
(not sure it has been updated for the new app by Marc Culler).

Some dependencies and optional package available via Homebrew "taps":

- GAP via the [GAP tap](https://github.com/gap-system/homebrew-gap)
- cddlib, cohomcalg, csdp, factory, fflas-ffpack,
  fourtitwo, frobby, gfan, givaro, lrs, macaulay2, mathic,
  mathicgb, memtailor, mpsolve, normaliz, openblas, topcom
  via the [Macaulay2 tap](https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap),
  thanks to work by Mahrud Sayrafi,
  see [brew formulas](https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap/tree/main/Formula)
  (though different choices than Sage with respect to multithreading
  can [cause problems](https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap/issues/68))

There are probably others I'm not aware of.
