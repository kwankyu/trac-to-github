<div id="comment:0"></div>

as follows:

```
sage: pari('x+O(x^2)')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PariError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-29-3844ab2b33fc> in <module>()
----> 1 pari('x+O(x^2)')

cypari2/pari_instance.pyx in cypari2.pari_instance.Pari.__call__()

cypari2/gen.pyx in cypari2.gen.objtogen()

cypari2/convert.pyx in cypari2.convert.PyObject_AsGEN()

cypari2/handle_error.pyx in cypari2.handle_error._pari_err_handle()

PariError: O(_^_): incorrect type in O (t_SER)
```
whereas it works in gp:

```
sage: %gp

  --> Switching to PARI/GP interpreter <--

pari: x+O(x^2)
x + O(x^2)
```

This prevents automatic testing of PARI code in oeis.

EDIT:

But this works:

```
sage: pari('x+O(x)^2')
x + O(x^2)
```

Yes, it now works. Since it is upstream in cypari2, I don't think we need to (or should) add a doctest.

I am doing okay. I am confined to Australia since they closed their boarders and there are essentially no international flights from Australia. However I am still able to go outside and to my office at UQ. However, the situation seems to change daily without much warning, so who knows how long that will last.
