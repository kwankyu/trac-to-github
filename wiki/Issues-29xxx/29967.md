Thanks for fixing this. I tried twenty different seeds and got no doctest failures.

I don't think the warnings from r.py have anything to do with this ticket, and they are certainly not a reason to keep this ticket open.  (I get them even with `random-seed=0`.) I opened ticket #31300 for anyone who is concerned about those warnings.
