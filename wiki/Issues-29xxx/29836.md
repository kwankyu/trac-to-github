```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex(backend='normaliz')
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: P.dilation(sqrt2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'generator' object has no attribute 'list'
```

The reason for this is simple. With optimization in #29200, it seems that generators are passed down to the normaliz backend and this isn't ready for this yet (when converting the data to the normaliz field).

the last line needs to be optional as well. If you don't have `pynormalize` you get a nice `NameError: name P is not defined` message in your doctests.
