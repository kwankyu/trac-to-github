We migrate `is_neighborly` and `neighborliness` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.
It is also faster now, as use the f-vector instead of indirectly getting the number of k-faces.

Along the way we add `is_simplex` to `CombinatorialPolyhedron` and cache the methods `f_vector` and `n_vertices`.

Small coding style:

-        Returns the largest ``k``, such that the polyhedron is ``k``-neighborly.

You can put this on positive review on my behalf once this is fixed.
