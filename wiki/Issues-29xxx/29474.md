For matrices, it is very easy to pass back and forth between sparse and dense representations.

```
sage: M = Matrix([[2,3],[4,5]])
sage: M.is_dense()
True
sage: M.is_sparse()
False
sage: M1 = M.sparse_matrix(); parent(M1)
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 sparse matrices over Integer Ring
sage: M2 = M1.dense_matrix(); parent(M2)
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring
```
It should be possible to do similar for polynomials, power series, and Laurent series, for which we also support both sparse and dense representations.
