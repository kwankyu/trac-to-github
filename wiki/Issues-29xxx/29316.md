With #27351, `configure` suggests a list of system packages to install.
The printed messages are easy to miss if users rely on `make` to invoke `configure`.

In this ticket, we make it an error to invoke `make` on an un-`configure`d source tree.

sub-configures prepare other makefiles, not the main makefile, so this is not recursive, as opposed to what we have at the top level now, where we basically run `make && ./configure` in a loop until we reach a stable point, from which we can `make`.

Yes, our `distclean` is non-standard in this regard. There is a target `bdist-clean` that deletes that extra file.

> Should it?

Hard to tell. I am not sure about the intended meaning of `misc-clean`, `bdist-clean`, `distclean`, `bootstrap-clean`, `maintainer-clean`, `fast-rebuild-clean`, as well as `micro_release`. Perhaps @vbraun could weigh in here.

I basically agree, but the last line in this passage from the top-level `README.md` must be changed:

```
The `configure` script itself, if it is not already built, can be generated by
running the `bootstrap` script (the latter requires _GNU autotools_ being installed).
The top-level `Makefile` also takes care of this automatically.
```
Maybe this whole section of `README.md` should be changed? I don't know if there are other parts of the documentation we also need to change.

I can certainly delete the line, but someone who knows autotools, configure files, etc., should really read this section and make any necessary changes.
