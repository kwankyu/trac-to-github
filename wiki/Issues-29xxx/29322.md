<div id="comment:0"></div>

There are many spkgs whose testsuites fail.

`sage-spkg` uses the following defaults:

```
# Since Python's self-tests seem to fail on all platforms, we disable
# its test suite by default.
if [ -z "$SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES" ]; then
    SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES='!python2,!python3'
fi
```

More should be added to adjust for expected failures.

- `pathpy` -- `spkg-check` picks up top-level `tox.ini` and gets confused
