This ticket tracks a random segmentation fault in `plural.pyx` that occasionally appears with Singular ≥ 4.1.1p3. The corresponding doctest is disabled in #25993.

```

If this error occurs when running the tests, it is usually persistent and reproducible, but isolating the problem is difficult, as the corresponding doctest does not fail when run standalone.

See #25993 for more details.
