A few funny things can happen when copying cached methods:

```
sage: class A:
...       @cached_method
...       def f(self):
...           return 1
...
sage: class B:
...       g=A.f
...       def f(self):
...           return 2
...       
...
sage: b=B()
sage: b.f()
2
sage: b.g()
1
sage: b.f()
1
```

The problem is that a call to b.g leads to a new MethodCaller in b.f; something similar happens here:

```
sage: class C:
...       g=A.f
...
sage: c=C()
sage: c.g is c.g
False
sage: c.g is c.f
True
```

Is that a new bug (i.e., introduced by my code from #11115)?

Anyway, it is not clear to me how the problem could be solved. Namely, a cached method knows the name under which it was defined, but if one assigns it to a different name afterwards, I see no way for the cached method to find out that new name.
