The current loading page of the Mac App is hideous and not as informative as it could be.  Also the link to `localhost:8000` will soon become `localhost:8080` with the new flask notebook (see #11080).  Both of these should be fixed without remorse.

Depends on #11080

Yes it should ignore the whitespace.  As to sizes of h1, etc. I just modified some css from sagemath.org so that I would get the colors right and they had changed the sizes.
