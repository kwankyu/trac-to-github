`sage -advanced` gives the following description for the option `-preparse`:

```
  -preparse <file.sage> -- preparse file.sage and produce corresponding file.sage.py
```
Testing this, preparsing a file `$file.sage` creates a file `$file.py`, not `$file.sage.py`. The documentation should be fixed to take this into account.

To fix, apply doc-fix.patch in sage_root, and doc-fix-2.patch in sage.
