Richard Brent has tables of prime factors of numbers of the form b<sup>k</sup> + 1 and b<sup>k</sup> - 1 extending beyond the scope of the Cunningham tables.  They can be found at his website http://maths.anu.edu.au/~brent/factors.html.  This spkg adds them to Sage, and the corresponding patch uses the data in integer factorization if it's available.

Depends on #12125

Few comments:

* `PrimeTable` is maybe a bit too generic, maybe `PrimeFactorTable` would be better?
* suggest `sage -i brent_tables` to install the package, it means less updating of the sage library
* optional tag should match the name of the spkg

Do these tables include the Cunningham tables? If so, wouldn't it make sense to make a function that returns the `BrentDatabase` if these tables are installed or the `CunninghamDatabase` if they are not (like how the `CremonaDatabase` is done). That way the only part of the sage library that would care about which database is being used is this database code (also, you wouldn't have to do your funky `BrentDatabase` initializer).
