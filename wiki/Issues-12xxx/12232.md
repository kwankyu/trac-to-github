**Attachment:** [trac_12232_interrupt_behavior.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12232/trac_12232_interrupt_behavior.patch)

The `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb` that is shipped with current versions of Sage is no longer under development. It has been superseded by the so-called Flask notebook, which has been rewritten during 2011 to use Flask as its webapp backend. Development is currently being migrated from Google Code to GitHub: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb

While it is not shipped with Sage, the Flask notebook can be installed into Sage with some effort (see instructions at http://code.google.com/r/jasongrout-flask-sagenb/ ). This has been done on, for example, http://sagenb.org/ .

So it is probably more worthwhile for you to hack on the Flask notebook. Unfortunately the code you are patching is [marked as broken](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/sagenb/simple/twist.py#L8), so a lot more work would be required, it seems.

Sorry about this not being self-evident from the documentation / other sources...

Thanks for the update, kini.

If the simple server API ever gets ported to the Flask version, I hope this issue and #9785 are taken into account so that the same mistakes are not repeated. Otherwise, I have found the simple server API to be quite useful.

Anyway, another option is just to say the simple server API has been removed and mark all these tickets as invalid.
