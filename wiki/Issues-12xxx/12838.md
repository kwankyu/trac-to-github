```
The patch fixes the issue that the one element root poset in type A1 was not returned correctly.

```
sage: Phi = RootSystem(['A',1]).root_poset(); Phi
Finite poset containing 1 elements
sage: Phi.cover_relations()
[]
```

I also added the facade option for root posets.

Not quite smoothly:

```

Hunk #1 succeeded at 507 with fuzz 2 (offset -34 lines).

Anyway, I rebased it.
