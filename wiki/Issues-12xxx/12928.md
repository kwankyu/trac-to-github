consider the following (both with Sage 4.8 and Sage 5.0.beta13 without `proof=False`):

```
sage: R.<x,y>=GF(2)[]
sage: factor(x^6 + y^6 + x^5 + x^3 + x + 1,proof=False)
x^6 + y^6 + x^5 + x^3 + x + 1
sage: (x^4+y^2*x^2+x^2+y^2*x+y^4+y^2+1)*(x^2+x+y^2+1)     
x^6 + y^6 + x^5 + x^3 + x + 1
```
This seems to be a bug in Singular factorization. I set the priority to "critical" since this is really a very basic routine.

here is another example:

```
sage: R.<x,t> = GF(2)[]
sage: f=x^6 + (t^5 + t^2)*x + t^5 + t^4 + t^3 + 1
sage: factor(f,proof=False)                      
x^6 + x*t^5 + t^5 + t^4 + x*t^2 + t^3 + 1
sage: f % (x+t+1)
0
```
Note that the factorization algorithm seems not to be deterministic, thus some times the
factorization is correct.
