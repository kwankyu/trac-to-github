```
maxima.eval('1+1;;')
``` 
hangs Sage. Now, this *is* a syntax error

```

(%i4) 1+1;;

(%o4) 2

stdin:76667:incorrect syntax: Premature termination of input at ;.
;
 ^
```
but at least we should fail gracefully, and maybe even give an answer.  

This was first reported at #8439, and separated from it.

One way of looking at this example is that it's two commands: A grammatical and an erroneous one. The pexpect interface for maxima does not seem to support parsing the output of multiple commands:

```
sage: maxima.eval("1+2;3+4;")
'3(%o17)7'
```
only a little better:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import maxima
sage: sage: maxima.eval("1+2;3+4;")
'37'
sage: maxima.eval("1+2;;")
'3'
```
This could be as easy as replacing ";<any whitespace>*;" by ";", but I'm not sure the slow-down of the extra regex is worth catching this corner-case.

Not that important because there's a better interface to maxima now:

sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import maxima_lib
sage: maxima_lib.eval("1+1;;")
'2'
