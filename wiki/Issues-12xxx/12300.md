Observed at #12214:

```
sage: polygon2d.options
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (0, 0, 1), 'thickness': 0}
sage: P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]]); P # looks blue
sage: polygon2d.options['rgbcolor']=(1,0,0)
sage: P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]]); P # looks red
sage: polygon2d.options
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (1, 0, 0), 'thickness': 0}
sage: polygon2d.defaults()
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (0, 0, 1), 'thickness': 0}
sage: polygon2d.reset()
sage: polygon2d.options
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (1, 0, 0), 'thickness': 0} # so you'd think it would be still red
sage: P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]]); P # but looks blue again like it should
```
So notice that options behave correctly, but don't print correctly for some reason.
