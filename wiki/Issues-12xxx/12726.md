Introduce a `SAGE32` environment variable, which will make Sage build a 32-bit version, even if the operating system is a 64-bit system.  This needs 32-bit libraries (libc,...) installed on the system.

This will only be supported on Linux using the `linux32` program (through the `personality(2)` system call).  It should be seen as an "experimental" feature which may or may not work.  The main goal is to use this for the buildbots.

Requirements for build systems in this setting:
* autoconf: just works
* Python: needs that the 32-bit libraries installed are the same as the 64-bit libraries installed.  If you have a 64-bit `libjpeg` but not a 32-bit `libjpeg`, PIL will fail to compile.  If you have both or neither, then PIL will compile.
