It's still possible that `make install` could fail, leaving GCC without an MPFR. The only solution I see to that would be to move the libs to a temp directory before `make install` and remove them afterwards.

Is it even worth worrying about? You don't need GCC to `make install`. I'll give a positive review as-is; I just want to make sure it's a conscious decision to ignore that case.

I think it's not so likely that "make install" would fail, since it essentially only copies files.  It could fail with "No space left on device".
