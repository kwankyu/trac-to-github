<div id="comment:0"></div>

Projective linear groups such as PGL(n, q) are represented
as abstract permutation groups.

```
sage: PGL(2, 13)
Permutation Group with generators [(3,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4), (1,2,9)(3,8,10)(4,5,12)(6,13,14)]
```
However, no method has been implemented that represents
elements of such groups as n-by-n matrices (though there is
a method that outputs each element as a permutation matrix).
It would be desirable to have such a thing.
