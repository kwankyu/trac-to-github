Hmmm.... I am sorry but these things are really dangerous... `:-/`

What would happen if one of the functions BipartiteGraph inherits has to compute the complement of the graph at some point ? The result would not be the one intended.... `:-/`

Travis, can you comment this?

If I make a special case for `BipartiteGraph`, it will break if there will be another subclass of `Graph`. So I should just check for `isinstance(g, sage.graphs.digraph.DiGraph)` and `isinstance(g, sage.graphs.graph.Graph)` and then make a copy like `Graph(self)`. However the docstring for that says "Please use this method only if you need to copy but change the underlying implementation or weightedness.  Otherwise simply do `copy(g)` - -".

So what is the right thing to do?
