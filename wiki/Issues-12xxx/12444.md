These method calls occur within other methods of the class, and so gcc just lets it side by. clang on the other hand does not, so this is either fixable by prefixing all these method calls with the class name, or with "this->" (I chose the latter since then I didn't have to pay attention to the class names).

I've posted an spkg fixes this at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/givaro-3.2.13.rc1.p4.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/givaro-3.2.13.rc1.p4.spkg). (This is a review spkg in case there are more issues with clang down the road.)

At least some of these instances break the build with GCC 4.7.0 (without `-fpermissive`) as well, hence I also made an spkg fixing these (hundreds?) at #12761, along with a major clean-up of the spkg.

I can't tell whether I've changed all instances you catched, but I fixed all such that Givaro's test suite as well as the Sage library would build with GCC 4.7.0.
