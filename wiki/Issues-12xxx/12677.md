<div id="comment:0"></div>

sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec uses Poset as example in its doctests. Thus, each time Poset is modified, this file (and its analogue in sagenb) needs to be updated. 

This patch replaces the doctest by one that does not depend on other Sage sources. #12536 depends on it.
