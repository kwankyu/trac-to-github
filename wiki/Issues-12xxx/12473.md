here is a fix : http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/ratpoints-2.1.3.tar.bz2
(I moved the only nested function outside; it works with gcc, and passes the tests (in sage)). Wonder how it goes with clang...

Still needs a bit of cleaning.

The PARI developers are not just "anybody" :-) I trust that they know number theory. Besides, the way that I understand things, the code in PARI is actually based on this `ratpoints` package. They didn't write it from scratch.

"better" maintained? I don't think that `ratpoints` is maintained *at all* given that the latest release is from 2011.
