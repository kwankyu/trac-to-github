As you can see in this patch, there were three wrong (quietly disfunctional) calls in the sage library itself.

I'll think if there is something I can do with BipartiteGraph constructor. It's quite messy.

Wow, veeeeeeery good idea !!!

Several remarks :

* in BipartiteGraph : could you explicit in the description of the ``check`` flag what "changing the graph to be bipartite" means ? The documentation later says "However, if one specifies check=False, the offending edges are simply deleted (along with those vertices not appearing in either list)" but it is easy to miss.

* Your test 

```
if len(partition[0]) > 0 or len(partition[1]) > 0: 
```
      Can be replaced by

```
if partition[0] or partition[1]: 
```
      Python is funny sometimes `:-p`
* Why did you replace 

```
#. An arbitrary graph (finds a bipartition). 
#. A graph and a bipartition. 
```
      By

```
#. An arbitrary graph. 
```
      ? `O_o`
* The line "- all remaining arguments are passed to the ``Graph`` constructor" would fit well inside of a ".. NOTE::" field.

* What about making what "``convert_empty_dict_labels_to_None``" does more explicit ? Something saying "you don't have to care as long as you do not deal with NetworkX". For instance : "This arguments sets the default edge labels used by NetworkX (empty dictionaries) to be replaced by ``None``, the default Sage edge label. It is set to ``True`` by default.

Well, the *data* argument doesn't hold any information about partition. "A graph and a bipartion" seems like someone could write BipartiteGraph(data=(Graph(...), [...]))

My God. It thought it was because I had intalled GAP recently on my machine... There there are exceptions which are not read correctly.. I'll take care of that `O_o`

Well....

So.

In his patch Lukasz replaced the arguments to Graph that were in the files by what they *intended*. For instance, he replaced dense=True by sparse=False, which makes sense. The thing is that the "dense" value was not read by the Graph backend, and as a result writing Graph(dense=True) actually created a sparse Graph.
He replaced the values by what was meant, but what was executed was actually different.
So I replaced the code, in this second patch, by what was actually run.

All this tells us is that there's something very wrong with the Dense graph backends. That's urgent to fix but does not mean computations went wrong before, precisely because the dense backend is almost never used.

This patch "solves the problem". And I created ticket #12387 for the dense backend problem.
