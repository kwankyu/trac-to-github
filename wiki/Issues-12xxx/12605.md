Well, you might be right that this is totally inconsistent.  I think that that was a design decision a looooong time ago, and I don't quite know where we all use rgbcolor versus color.   Reminds me of the difference between alpha (2d) and opacity (3d) which is sort of silly.  Anyway, I'm not thinking about this today.
