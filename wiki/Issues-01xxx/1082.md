Currently, "sage -upgrade" automatically checks in code in sage-main (asking you for a commit message, etc.) without explaining what's happening, and what exactly is being checked in.

Instead, "sage -upgrade" should either explain what's going on before it checks in the code, or explain what's going on and then exit without doing anything, so the user can use hg_sage.ci().
