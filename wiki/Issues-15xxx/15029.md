In the paper Similarity of matrices over local rings of length two [http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6157](http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6157), the similarity classes of n x n matrices with entries in a principal ideal local ring of length two are computed for n = 2, 3, 4. These calculations are being implemented in sage.

Hey Amri,

It seems like you've created 2 classes which are basically computing a few methods and don't contain helper methods. I would instead move these to (module-level) functions in `similarity_class_type.py` which take the `data, q, selftranspose, invertible` as arguments since there is:

- no complicated internal state across multiple functions,
- no complicated/expensive standardization or preparation needed on the inputs,
- no element classes,
- no classes inheriting from these.

Two other minor points:

- Could you use the arXiv autolink format: <code>:arxiv.org:\`1212.6157\`</code>?
- Could you remove the `[mq]:...` line from the patch header by doing a `qrefresh -e`?

Thanks,

Travis

Hey Amri,

Here's a review patch which does a few things:

- Changes the name of the functions `*2` to `*_length_two` to be a little more explicit.
- Adds `INPUT:` blocks to some of the functions.
- Fixes some docstring mistakes I didn't catch the first time around in the whole file. I also converted it to use Sage's macro for finite fields `\GF{q}`.

If you're happy with my changes, go ahead and set this to positive review.

Thanks for your work on this,

Travis
