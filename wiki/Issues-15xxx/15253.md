i read `coerce_binop` at `sage/structure/element.pyx`, but do not understand what is the use case for Polyhedron, can someone give some hints? 

when you remove the `@`coerce_binop decorator, the example in `product` (/polyhedron/base.py) still transforms to `QQ^2` when asked for `P1 * P2`.

Hi, this is not a solution! i'm posting a commented session where i learned something new about this issue..

first, the problem:

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(1)
sage: Q = polytopes.hypercube(2)
sage: P * Q
...
TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: 'Polyhedra in ZZ^1' and 'Polyhedra in ZZ^2'
```

it arises from using the `@coerce_binop` decorator at the definition of (Cartesian) `product`. indeed,

```
sage: P.parent()
Polyhedra in ZZ^1
sage: Q.parent()
Polyhedra in ZZ^2
sage: P.parent().parent()
<class 'sage.geometry.polyhedron.parent.Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl_with_category'>
sage: Q.parent().parent()
<class 'sage.geometry.polyhedron.parent.Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl_with_category'>
```

in consequence:

```
sage: P.parent() is Q.parent()  # ok
False
sage: P.parent().parent() is Q.parent().parent()  # ok
True
```

on the other side, in `def coerce_binop(method)` it uses `have_same_parent`:

```
sage: from sage.structure.element import have_same_parent
sage: have_same_parent(P, Q)   # ok
False
sage: have_same_parent(P.parent(), Q.parent())   # why False?
False
```

so already at the level of `coerce_binop` there is this a bit strange thing one would say (?). also related is the Warning block in the definition of `cpdef inline bint have_same_parent(left, right):`, which says

This function assumes that at least one of the arguments is a
Sage :class:`Element`. When in doubt, use the slower
``parent(left) is parent(right)`` instead.

To sum up:

- perhaps one could define a custom `@coerce_binop_polyhedron` decorator which checks for grandparents, and which does not use `have_same_parent`.
- alternatively, if it is indeed ok that `if have_same_parent(self, other)` gives False in this situation, then one should define a "canonical coercion" so that the method `coercion_model.canonical_coercion(self, other)` doesn't fail. but where?

Disclaimer: I am not an expert in polytopes. I feel like this is the correct error as there is not a canonical way to embed a **Z** polytope into a **Z**<sup>2</sup> polytope.

However, that is not the issue with the ticket as the product is still well-defined, but what actually should be tested is that the base rings can be made into a common parent:

```
P.base_ring().has_coerce_map_from(Q.base_ring())
```
So if that is `False`, then an error should be raised. Otherwise it should change the base ring of both polytopes to this common ring and proceed.
