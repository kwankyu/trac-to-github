Hellooooooooooo Rob !

Nicely spotted. I had written "Mederith" instead of "Meredith", and of course it had to fail somewhere `:-P`

I just updated my branch by changing the last commit instead of commiting a one-line change, which I am told is a dangerous thing to do in general. Doing dangerous things is the best way to learn quickly how it all works `:-P`

I hope that it will be fine on your side ! `:-)`

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !

All fine on your side.  I spent *forever* trying to make it a "tracking" branch on my side.  Maybe details on sage-git later today.

All good for a positive review.

I added a commit hash in the "Commit" field - I hope that is right.

Helloooo Rob !!!

Hmmmm... I don't even know what that means yet :-P

Hmmmmm.. Some time ago I think I saw a discussion on sage-git that I didn't understand at that time about whether we should use branches or commits references. And I think that we should use branches instead, for the following reason :
* This Meredith patch was uploaded yesterday, when the git version of Sage was still version 5.11.rc0
* I then updated my version of sage-git to 5.12 with a git pull
* I now want to write a patch #15049 that is based upon this patch

The point now, is that this patch's commit was created before 5.12. Hence if I want to write #15049 atop this patch, I can't be above 5.12 too. What I could do, however, is rebase this patch atop 5.12, hence updating the u/ncohen/meredith branch, then write #15049 on this new meredith branch which is above 5.12.

The problem is that the hash of a commit changes when you rebase it. Or at least I found no way to avoid that O_o

Sooooooo hoping that it is not a problem, I will try to rebase this patch above 5.12 (and there should not be any conflict), update the commit field to match the new version of the meredith commit, then base #15049 atop of that.

I hope all of that was clear `:-P`

Have fuuuuuuuuuun ! And thank you again `:-)`

Right. I just replaced it with a "long time".

And because I had to make this small new commit, and because I merged it with this Meredith patch, I had to rebase and reupload #15049. Because git remembers the hash of its dependencies, and so even if the small modifications that you make do not create any conflict you have to rebase everything above `T_T`

This is going to be painful in the very near future O_O
