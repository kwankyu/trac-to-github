Sage --help says that sage --M2 (for example) runs "Sage's Macaulay2", but it might actually run the system version. Especially since we don't have a working M2 spkg.


This needs to be checked in
* src/bin/sage
* src/doc/en/reference/repl/options.rst
* src/sage/misc/dist.py

Component: **user interface**
