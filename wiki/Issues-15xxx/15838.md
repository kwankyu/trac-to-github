Due to a missing SPKG Sage did not build, but when I wanted to `sage -dev push` it said

```
Developer interface disabled.

To develop for Sage you must compile Sage from its git
repository. This just amounts to running

    git clone git://github.com/sagemath/sage.git
    cd sage
    make

See https://github.com/sagemath/trac_to_gh/wiki/QuickStartSageGit for slightly more
information.
```
Rather it should give the same `Oops, Sage crashed...` message which it does when I try to start it without options.

Component: **user interface**

Keywords: **crash message**
