It has nothing to do with `ipython` because `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ipython` is only one of the many scripts which are rewritten by `sage-location`.

Perhaps you should explain why the "hack" in `sage-location` should be removed.

By special-casing `ipython` you are achieving absolutely nothing: the "hack" in `sage-location` still exists and you're just fooling the doctest.

Depends what you mean. The path-rewriting is needed to be able to relocate the Sage install tree.

Let me repeat this: By special-casing `ipython` you are achieving absolutely nothing: the "hack" in `sage-location` still exists and you're just fooling the doctest.

A proper fix for the "hack" would fix all Python scripts, not just this one. What's the point of this special case?

What i mean is, there is no point in requiring the mechanism for `ipython`. Most (maybe not all) cases are like this.

> Let me repeat this: By special-casing `ipython` you are achieving absolutely nothing: the "hack" in `sage-location` still exists and you're just fooling the doctest.

there's a proper doctest in #15146, that does not rely on a wrong ipython installation.

> A proper fix for the "hack" would fix all Python scripts, not just this one. 

Yes.

> What's the point of this special case?

I cannot fix all at once. But before the line has been merged, I will certainly not paste it into the other `spkg-install` files.

You just gave a very good argument for keeping the `sage-location` "hack": it **does** rewrite all the paths at once without trouble. What's wrong with that?

No, I'm trying to make Sage a sane place. Something like this takes time.

It doesn't do anything useful in *most* cases. If there were no doctest looking at ipython i wouldn't even have noticed. A hack should always be restricted to things that require it. This is pretty similar to the problem about static atlas libraries (#15045): Its always better to not break/complicate things for *all* users just because one CPU/platform is broken/limitied/buggy.

> I think you still need to explain what the problem is that this ticket is trying to fix, I really don't understand it.

Here we go, a more formal argument. read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(object-oriented_programming). There is a file that takes care of the contents of a package (`spkg-install`). Nothing beyond that is required. Other routines/programs that mess wich package contents, like `sage-location` does, violate encapsulation. Encapsulation, in general, is useful to keep things comprehensible and simple.
