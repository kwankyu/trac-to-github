Currently,

```
sage: beta(-1.3,-0.4)
NaN
sage: (gamma(-1.3) * gamma(-0.4)) / gamma(-1.3 - 0.4) # expected functionality
-4.92909641669610
```

This is because GiNaC uses `exp(log_gamma(-1.3)+log_gamma(-0.4)-log_gamma(-1.3-0.4))` to evaluate, and `log_gamma` is broken for some input (see #12521). Using mpmath is faster and avoids roundoff errors as well.

The ticket is fixed in Pynac and should doctest the issue.

Depends on #21034
