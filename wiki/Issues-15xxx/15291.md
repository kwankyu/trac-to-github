Example:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ['x','y']
sage: Q = R.quotient([x^2 - y + 1, y^3 + 3 * x - 7])
sage: A = Matrix(Q, [[1,0,1],[0,1,1]])
sage: M = Matroid(A)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: 
```

Solution:

Catch NotImplementedError in a try... except block. Probably do the same for the order() test in the same line of code of sage/matroids/constructor.py

I'm not sure what should be written inside the except block.How do we construct a matroid from a ring which is not a field, and which function to use.Please clarify,seeing the code i've pasted!

```python
if 'matrix' in kwds:
            if base_ring == GF(2):
                M = BinaryMatroid(groundset=kwds['groundset'], matrix=A)
            elif base_ring == GF(3):
                M = TernaryMatroid(groundset=kwds['groundset'], matrix=A)
            else:
                try:
                    if base_ring.is_field():
                        try:
                            if base_ring.order() == 4:  # GF(4) can have different generators.
                                M = QuaternaryMatroid(groundset=kwds['groundset'], matrix=A)
                            else:
                                M = LinearMatroid(groundset=kwds['groundset'], matrix=A, ring=base_ring)
                        except NotImplementedError:
                            raise NotImplementedError
                except NotImplementedError:

Not completely accurate. Matroid theory research includes matroids representable over "partial fields", where the entries are from a ring, and the submatrix determinants are all zero or in a multiplicative group of units from that ring.

Sage's LinearMatroid class has support for partial fields, especially through the "fundamentals=" argument to some methods. Internally everything was designed to work with such matrices. Consideration for these lead to tickets like #17692 and #15297 and #15295 .

I assume #23382 fixes the issue reported here (I'll try to review that this weekend), so I will leave this ticket as positive_review.
