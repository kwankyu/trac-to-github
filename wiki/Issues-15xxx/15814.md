The old package still uses $SAGE_DATA and so it fails to install after sage-6.0. Moreover, it should be upgraded as the newest version is http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/roed/cunningham_tables-2.2.spkg

That version however still uses $SAGE_DATA but the upgrader could just fix that by changing usage of it to $SAGE_SHARE.

Maintainer is cc'ed.

See #7240 why this should be standard, the vote has happened.

The `sage-spkg` script simply grabs any `spkg-install` in the tarball without looking into `build/pkgs/cunningham_tables` so, unless this has been enhanced, the only way to present this patched SPKG is by giving the patch above.

So, to include the new package, download the SPKG from the link above, extract the tarball, and patch the `spkg-install` using the snippet above. The Sage tarball patch mechanism is not usable here, AFAIK, and neither is git.
