So this ticket seems that this ticket is getting some attention again. I would like to adres the comments above so that this ticket can get a positive review and get merged. 

However before this the question: should this ticket be "won't fix" or should it be given a mile stone again in order to get merged still has to be settled. Right now there only seems to be one person that thinks that this should be "won't fix". So I would say we should give it a mile stone again. But it doesn't feel like good behavior to do that myself as I am the author of this ticket.
