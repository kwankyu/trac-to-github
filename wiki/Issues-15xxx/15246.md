Reassigning a ticket to "won't fix" *and* giving the positive review by the same person is bad form. I happen to think it's a fun easter egg. Xkcd often does have relevant and highly quotable mathematics-related cartoons.

Although the specific comic itself is probably one of the greatest ones out there for \"pure\" math types (though I was amazed at the haters out there for this one).  Maybe we can use the ... in the title attribute of the img link?  Or do you have a different comic suggestion?  I looked a few just now but the rest of the better math-specific ones are (of course) somewhat more sub-discipline specific.",

> I happen to think there is a valid reason to insert this easter egg: it might earn Sage a mention in a future xkcd comic, which would be excellent marketing. I can even imagine a "Droste effect" where one of the characters uses Sage, mistypes the xgcd command and sees... him/herself.

Given that the author has already been interviewed in Math Horizons, I think this is a definite possibility.
> My one complaint is the use of an NSFW doctest. Surely we can be less immature than that! (This reminds me of the discovery of "B00B135" in some shipped Microsoft code. Not helpful.)

Hmm, very good point.  Although the specific comic itself is probably one of the greatest ones out there for "pure" math types (though I was amazed at the haters out there for this one).  Maybe we can use the ... in the title attribute of the img link?  Or do you have a different comic suggestion?  I looked a few just now but the rest of the better math-specific ones are (of course) somewhat more sub-discipline specific.
