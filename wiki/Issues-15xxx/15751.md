I was in an indented block for a `for` loop and made a change to a file I had attached via `%attach` and got the following error:

```
sage: for w in W:
### reloading attached file simple_spanning_number.py modified at 16:35:33 ###
  File "<ipython-input-35-65c783506996>", line 2
    sage.misc.preparser.load(sage.misc.preparser.base64.b64decode("L2hvbWUvdHJhdmlzL0Ryb3Bib3gvc2ltcGxlX3NwYW5uaW5nX251bWJlci5weQ=="),globals(),True)
       ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block

If you want to paste code into IPython, try the %paste and %cpaste magic functions.
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Not a major thing since it is a rare event to me, but it is still an annoying error message and it kills my for loop.

I guess we should disable the idle loop callback while we are in a IPython stateful block...
