Complementary to finite sequences, implement infinite sequences associated with a category, and as elements of a suitable paren. This parent class should be abstract, with subclass `GeneratedSequence`, itself as a template to forthcoming subclasses, for example `CFiniteSequenceRing` (#15714), `PFiniteSequence...` (), `AutomaticSequence...` (#13542).

This ticket may be obsolete mainly because of #15852 which first had a different (and grander) direction. Now it's just to move `Sequence` out of `categories`.
