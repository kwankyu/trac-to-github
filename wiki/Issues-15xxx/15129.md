If we want to automatically update the "Commit" field then we have to be able to identify the ticket given the "Branch". Here is a quick trac plugin to search for "Branch", returning only exact matches. Both via webui and trac xmlrpc.

Install trac_plugin_search_branch.py​ into trac, e.g. upload via web console.
