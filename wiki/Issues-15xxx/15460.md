I think all these files should simply be **exactly** the files generated by (a recent version of) SageTeX, without any manual changes. For example, the change from `...` to `....:` shouldn't be done here, but in the book.

That would be nice, but when some new patch causes minor output changes, what tends to happen is that the author of the patch modifies the files in `src/sage/tests/` directly, and we port the changes to the book aftwerwards. Of course, it would be better to notify us so that we make the change in the book and provide a patch based on what sagetex outputs. But I don't think it would be very nice to ask people to do that—especially given that we are not always responsive!  (Doing it "right" will get easier with the switch to git, however.)

That being said, I will see if I can prepare a patch that re-syncs the files in the sage tree with the output of sagetex.
