Comparisons need to be defined for all values of a type to leverage the coercion system. What is the expected output of comparison with an RIF interval that includes infinity? 

```
sage: to_inf = RIF(0, oo) 
sage: to_inf
[0.00000000000000000 .. +infinity]
sage: oo < to_inf

#13125 changes this to:

(False, False, False)

I propose to close this ticket as duplicate.
