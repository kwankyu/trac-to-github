I get lots of test failures (probably whenever importing somethnig)

```
File "src/doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/Interact.rst", line 31, in doc.en.prep.Quickstarts.Interact
Failed example:
    plot(x^2,(x,-3,3))
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:974: UserWarning: /home/release/.python-eggs is writable by group/others and vulnerable to attack when used with get_resource_filename. Consider a more secure location (set with .set_extraction_path or the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable).
```
My home directory is (why does setuptools even create that directory?)

```
$ ll -d ~/.python-eggs
drwxrwxr-x. 1 release release 78 Feb  1 23:22 /home/release/.python-eggs
```
so it is entirely intentional that it is group writeable.

Never mind, I see the directory now. It looks like we can change its location by setting the variable `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE`. It seems like we should do this in `spkg-install` (or in `sage-env`?). What should it be? `"$DOT_SAGE/.python-eggs"`? Something in the Sage build directory? By the way, we can also (or instead) patch the function `_warn_unsafe_extraction_path` in `src/pkg_resources.py` to silence the error.
