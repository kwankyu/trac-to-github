I noticed in testing #24758 a minor issue when displaying symbolic min/max objects with `hold=True` that the repr is useless given a list argument:

```
sage: max_symbolic([1, 2], hold=True)
max(<listiterator object at 0x7fb40a873d50>)
```

This is a problem on both Python 2 and 3--it might be a regression too but I'm not sure.
