<div id="comment:0"></div>

In `src/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py`, there is the following code:

```
dom_alph.sort()
```
and

```
return FiniteWords(sorted(codom_alphabet))
```

These will break with #22029.

As explained in [comment:8], I still don't agree with this approach. It may be sufficient to fix existing doctests, but it doesn't address the real problem. This ticket simply replaces an obvious problem by a much more hidden problem.

If such a problem happen, that is an alphabet with uncomparable elements, the user can define the domain and cododmain himself by doing for instance `WordMorphism(data, domain=domain, codomain=domain)`. Would you like to add such a suggestion to the user for example within the error message for `is_endomorphism`?

Also, I think the best thing we should do with the move to Python 3 is to make it so that using alphabet with uncomparable letters is not desirable anymore.

Do you mean "with a *sortable* alphabet" ?

I updated a branch which fixes the 2 doctests. I also updated the class documentation: INPUT block was missing, the example block of the class doc was the same as the module doc, I erased it and replaced that by examples better suited for what is seen with `WordMorphism?` showing the different way of using the inputs.

Needs review.
