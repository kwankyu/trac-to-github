For this change:

```diff

-        if loops is False:
-            u = next(u for u,neighb in six.iteritems(M) if u in neighb)
-            raise ValueError("The graph was built with loops=False but input M has a loop at {}.".format(u))
-        loops = True
-    if loops is None:
-        loops = False
+    if any(not isinstance(M[u], dict) for u in M):

+
+    if not loops:

+                if loops is False:

+                break
+        if loops is None:
+            loops = False
```
the `any` call is actually faster. Granted, your change will result in a faster error, but I think an error message being here is unexpected. Hence it is allowed to be slow. If someone really wants the extra speed and is using that test to separate cases, they should run their own test instead of catching the error (which is faster). So I am inclined to revert this.

Also, strictly speaking, the items for `INPUT:` are not sentences and do not end in a period (although some of them are sufficiently long with multiple parts that require it). While I was letting this slide when it was previously there, the ones you are adding should not have it.

All of the other changes LGTM.

The following lines are apparently incompatible with Python 3 (see patchbot).

```diff
+        if any(u in neighb for u,neighb in six.iteritems(M)):
+                u = next(u for u,neighb in six.iteritems(M) if u in neighb)
```

```diff
+        if any(u in neighb for u, neighb in six.iteritems(D)):
+                u = next(u for u, neighb in six.iteritems(M) if u in neighb)
```
Is there a special trick or should I turn these lines to for loops ?

No, no. It's just the patchbot prefering "iteritems" to "six.iteritems". Just change the imports accordingly.

And once again, it is never mandatory to have all green lights from the patchbot, as the patchbot is not smart..

Doctest failures:

```
File "src/sage/graphs/digraph.py", line 399, in sage.graphs.digraph.DiGraph
Failed example:
    D = DiGraph('IRAaDCIIOEOKcPWAo')
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: The string (IRAaDCIIOEOKcPWAo) seems corrupt: for n = 10, the string is too short.
Got:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: the string (IRAaDCIIOEOKcPWAo) seems corrupt: for n = 10, the string is too short
```
and similar in `graph.py`. Once fixed and the patchbot comes back green, then it will be a positive review.
