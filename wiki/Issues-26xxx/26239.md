```

```
sage: Qx = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: F1 = NumberField(Qx([0,1]),'a1'); F1
Number Field in a1 with defining polynomial x
sage: F2 = NumberField(Qx([0,1]),'a2'); F2
Number Field in a2 with defining polynomial x
sage: F1.is_isomorphic(F2)
False
```

The bug is because of this:

```
sage: f1=F1.pari_polynomial(); f1
x
sage: f2=F2.pari_polynomial(); f2
x
sage: f1.nfisisom(f2)
[0]
sage: f1.nfisisom(f2) ==0
True
```

As far as I can see this problem will only arise when both fields are QQ, with defining polynomial 'x'.
So pari correctly finds an isomorphism but Sage thinks that paris's [0] is the same as pari's 0, the latter being what is returned when the fields are not isomorphic.

That's the underlying reason for the bug that we're trying to fix.

Checking the length is partially a hack and partially elegant at the same time. I would have checked the type (`t.type() == "t_VEC"`) but I'm fine your proposal.
