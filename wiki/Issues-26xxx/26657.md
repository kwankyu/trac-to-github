<div id="comment:0"></div>

The unitary Burau matrix has been implemented in #25760. The choice between the two adjoined possibilities has been made according to the used literature ([Squ1984]_).

Unfortunately, this is opposite to the convention used in Sage for example in :meth:`_check_matrix` of :class:`UnitaryMatrixGroup_generic`.

This discrepancy is corrected by the ticket. A deprecation of the former behavior doesn't seem to be necessary, since the new functionality has been released just a couple of months ago.
