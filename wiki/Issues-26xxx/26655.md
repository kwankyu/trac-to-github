<div id="comment:0"></div>

It should be possible to convert PARI matrices over finite fields into a Sage matrix space:

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(9)
sage: M = MatrixSpace(F, 2, 2)
sage: A = M.random_element()
sage: M(A.__pari__())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

This ticket deliberately does not attempt to fix conversion of PARI `t_VEC`/`t_COL` etc. to Sage matrices.  Maybe this should even be deprecated (there is a risk of confusion since Sage uses row-major order and PARI uses column-major order).

Component: **interfaces**

Keywords: **matrix, finite field, pari**
