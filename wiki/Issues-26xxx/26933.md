I wonder whether it is really worth the trouble (and performance hit) to keep the order of the ground set.

```
sage: S = [1, 8, -5, 3/2, 'a', x]
sage: import random
sage: L = [choice(S) for _ in range(10000)]
sage: %timeit list(set(L))
1000 loops, best of 3: 708 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit list(stable_uniq(L))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.4 ms per loop
```

(Currently, essentially all the time in `Subsets_s.__init__` is spent in `uniq`.)

I just realized something... the existing `uniq(X)` really just does `sorted(set(X))`. It seems a bit silly to write a function just for that and one can also wonder if the sorting is the right thing to do in general.

So I suggest that this new `stable_uniq` would *replace* `uniq`. Of course, a deprecation period is needed for that. So I'd rather use a private name like `_stable_uniq` for now.
