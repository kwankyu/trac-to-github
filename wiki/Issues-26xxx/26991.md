Most of the changes I proposed in the ticket description have already been done, but the element methods haven't been refactored, so that's all this ticket is now.  It's important to get it done, though, because I have another ticket that depends on this refactorization.

I didn't make any changes to `is_prime`; even though I think it should throw `NotImplementedError` for classes where it isn't implemented.  Maybe that's another ticket.
