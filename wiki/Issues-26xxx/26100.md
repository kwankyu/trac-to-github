In #25309 the path to the maxima ecl module was made configurable. However, the default path /usr/lib/ecl/maxima.fas is sage-specific (upstream ecl installs modules to the versioned path /usr/lib/ecl-${eclver}). This forces distributions who ship unmodified ecl to patch sage to point it to the right path. Even worse, the path depends on the ecl version so the patch would need to be updated for every ecl upgrade, creating additional burden.

This patch makes makes MAXIMA_FAS unset by default. For sage-the-distribution the behavior should be identical to 8.3. For distros that ship a vanilla ecl (ie. with versioned module dir) it should work out of the box as it did in 8.3. Distros that install maxima.fas to a non-standard location can still customize it.

In fact, `... is not None` is the appropriate test if `None` is used as a sentinel value. The empty string `""` would also be "False", and I imagine you might want to treat it differently from the value not being present. There are some wilder scenarios where it matters, e.g. if someone makes a string type that always tests `False`, but that is pretty exotic.

> For what its worth I still have to set `ECLDIR` for the nix package. I'm not sure why ECL needs that or what the default is when it is not set. Have you tested sage without a system ECL installed? Maybe its accidentally using that when removing `ECLDIR`.

From ecl's configure script:

AC_ARG_VAR([ecldir], [the directory where *.fas files are installed])
test -z "${ecldir}" && ecldir="${libdir}/ecl-${PACKAGE_VERSION}"

Sage works fine without a system ecl and without setting ECLDIR (even after removing it from sage-env). From #7186 setting it was added to fix issues after moving the sage tree - I wonder if that still makes sense now that moving the tree is no longer supported
