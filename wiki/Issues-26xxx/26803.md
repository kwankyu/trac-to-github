<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szeged_index, this index is defined for connected graphs only.

I added a test and a doctest, a link to the wikipedia page for easier access to definition,  and took the opportunity to do PEP8 cleaning of this method.
