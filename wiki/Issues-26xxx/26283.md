Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A2):
> * why the changes in affine_homset.py ?

> * the hash in affine_point.py is maybe not so good. Something similar has been discussed (but nothing was done) in #26188

Then that should be a separate issue.  All I care about here is the fact that it currently does not return a Python int as required.
