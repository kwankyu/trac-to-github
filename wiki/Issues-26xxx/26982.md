See #20695 deprecation, merged in 8.2.beta2.

Sage 8.2 released in May 2018, so this can be removed May 2019.

Note: the corresponding code is now available as an external package:

- [surface_dynamics](https://gitlab.com/videlec/surface_dynamics)


CC:  @slel @videlec @tscrim

Component: **dynamics**

Keywords: **surface_dynamics, interval_exchanges, flat_surfaces**
