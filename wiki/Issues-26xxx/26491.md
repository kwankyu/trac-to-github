When calling `dumps(fsm)` for some large finite state machine, maximum recursion depth might be exceeded:

```
  File "sage/misc/persist.pyx", line 285, in sage.misc.persist.dumps (build/cythonized/sage/misc/persist.c:4397)
  File "sage/misc/persist.pyx", line 256, in sage.misc.persist._base_dumps (build/cythonized/sage/misc/persist.c:3989)
  File "sage/misc/persist.pyx", line 835, in sage.misc.persist.SagePickler.dumps (build/cythonized/sage/misc/persist.c:6593)
  File "sage/misc/persist.pyx", line 592, in sage.misc.persist._BasePickler.dump (build/cythonized/sage/misc/persist.c:5664)
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
