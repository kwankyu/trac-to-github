I think an error should be raised in the following example:

```python
sage: f(x) = x**(1/3); f
x |--> x^(1/3)
sage: f.taylor(x,0,3)
x |--> x^(1/3)
```


Component: **calculus**

Keywords: **taylor series polynomial**

I'm not familiar with this notation for Taylor polynomials (which is surprising) but anyway to make it clear:

```
f.taylor(x,0,3)
x |--> x^(1/3)
```
For what it's worth, `f.series(x,3)` gives an error.

I have no idea where I got my made up notation for Taylor polynomials from. You're totally right. Fixed! Thanks!
