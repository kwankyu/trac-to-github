Trying to compile `example.tex` : LaTeX passes well, but :

```
sage example.sagetex.sage 
  File "example.sagetex.sage.py", line 433
    except ValueError, ZeroDivisonError:
                     ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Python3 seems to need 

```
    except (ValueEror, ZeroDivisionError):
```

The problem lies in `example.tex` : fixing it in the source code for the Gnuplot example allows for compilation.

A [pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex/pull/37) for the trivial fix consisting of the addition of a pair of parentheses in the relevant part of `example.tex` has been added to the Github site for Sagetex.

I *hope* this is the right procedure. If not, let me know...
