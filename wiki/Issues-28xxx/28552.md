```
sage: A.<a> = ZZ.extension(x^2 - 2)
sage: a.parent()
Order in Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 2
sage: from sage.structure.element import FieldElement
sage: isinstance(a, FieldElement)
True
```

As a consequence, `a` inherits unappropriate generic methods for field elements as `quo_rem`, `divides`, e.g:

```
sage: (a^2).divides(a)
True
```
