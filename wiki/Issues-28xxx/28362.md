It works fine over `ZZ` (which is PID)

```
sage: R = ZZ
sage: V = R**3
sage: V.submodule([V.an_element()])
Free module of degree 3 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0 0]
```
But it does not over `ZZ['x']`

```
sage: R = ZZ['x']
sage: V = R**3
sage: V.submodule([V.an_element()])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: mutable vectors are unhashable
```
even if the vector is set immutable

```
sage: v = V.an_element()
sage: v.set_immutable()
sage: V.submodule([v])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: mutable vectors are unhashable
```
