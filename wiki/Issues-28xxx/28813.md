Current implementation of symmetries has limited handling of symmetries that exclude for instance the symmetries of the Riemann tensor. 

One would naturally expect:

* To be able to (anti)symmetries a tensor to obtain general symmetries i.e. obtain via the action of an abritrary subgroup of the SymmetricGroup acting on indices. This should be possible both in index notation #28787 or via the methods {{symmetrize}} or {{antisymmetrize}}.

* To be able to check easily the symmetries of a tensor
* To declare symmetries of a tensor so that they are enforced during declaration on subsequent manipulations 
* To exploit such symmetries to accelerate computations

Indeed the Riemann tensor is an element of ` $\Lambda<sup>2S</sup>2T^*M$ `. These so-called Young symmetrizer indeed allow for the construction of wide classes of linear representation of the symmetric groups. As such they are special cases of linear representations of the symmetric group. 

I would say both view points are valid, I guess you suggest of more "linear group representation" approach while I was considering at first only symmetries on indices. 

Symmetries are very easy to implement since #28787 does something very close by implementing `permute_indices` method. 

I don't know enough about how group actions work in sage to form an enlightened opinion.

Absolutely. When I commented on #28784, I was mainly thinking of multi-symmetrizations like you implemented them, but generalizing this to group actions should indeed be straightforward.

As far as I know, this just requires defining a subclass of `sage.categories.action.Action` that implements `_act_`.

"generalizing this to group actions should indeed be straightforward"

To clariry, by "group actions", you mean **linear** group actions on the underlying vector space (like one can interpret while talking about Young symetrizers) or a simple group action one the indices?
