See discussion [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ukJgMweHszU](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ukJgMweHszU)

File `splay.c` has changed in `nauty` (at least in 26r12). The main difference is 

```diff
- static SPLAYNODE* 
- SPLAY_DELETE(SPLAYNODE **to_root, SPLAYNODE *p)
+ void
+ SPLAY_DELETE(SPLAYNODE **to_root, SPLAYNODE *p)
```
With this change, I can do `gcc -O3 -std=c89 buckygen.c -o buckygen`.

So upstream must be updated.
