This ticket adds a BFS-based computation of girth of directed graphs (i.e., length of shortest directed cycle). The existing algorithm, which did not work properly for directed graphs of girth larger than 2, is now moved to a hidden method in `graph.py`, and the same method in `digraph.py` now works properly for the directed case. The appropriate method is then called in `generic_graph.py` after checking some border cases.

Both methods also accept a parameter `odd`, which, when set to `True`, will make the methods compute the odd girth of a graph (length of shortest odd cycle). This was not previously available for directed graphs, while for undirected graphs, a method based on the characteristic polynomial was used. This is still available (in both the directed and undirected case) by setting the appropriate `algorithm` parameter - however, the default is now to use the above BFS-based algorithm. I have run some examples and the characteristic polynomial based method was almost always slower (it was only faster for bipartite graphs, which can be quickly checked), so I decided to set the `"bfs"` algorithm as default, with the other options available in case there is some class of graphs where it would be advantageous to use them.

Some quick comments:

- references must be put in file `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`. Then you can cite them in the documentation of the methods using `[Har62]_` and `[Biggs93]_`.

- in input blocks, the correct format is:

```diff
-        - ``odd`` -- whether to compute the odd girth (default: ``False``).
+        - ``odd`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to compute the odd girth
```

- in `generic_graph.py`, why not extending method `girth` by adding it parameter `odd` and then call the appropriate method for graph or digraph or bipartite graph or ... 

- Is it possible to add parameter `certificate` in these methods to return the cycle, if any ?

Regarding the parameter: I was thinking about that, actually. I forgot about `BipartiteGraph` - I guess the way to go would be to have the algorithm for undirected graphs in `generic_graph.py`, so it would also work for bipartite graphs.

Regarding the certificate, a cycle would only show that the (odd) girth is at most its length. Would that be OK?

I took the liberty to edit your code and push it in a new branch (in `public/` so that you can modify it as well).

I did various small corrections and added several doctests (for instance for small cases).

Please check that every think is fine and that the documentation builds properly and displays nicely.
