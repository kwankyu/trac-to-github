```markdown
Added a function in boolformula.py to check if one propositional formula tautologically implies the other.
An example of how the function works is below:
sage: f = propcalc.formula("a")
sage: g = propcalc.formula("a|b")
sage: f.TautologicallyImplies(g)
True
sage: g.TautologicallyImplies(f)
False
```


Component: **calculus**

Keywords: **logic**
