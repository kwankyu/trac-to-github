I mentioned on #28116, that if an exception is raised in a doctest that happens to contain non-ASCII bytes in its message, there is a `UnicodeDecodeError` that occurs when trying to mix the text of the exception with `unicode` strings.

This can be reproduced by running:

```
LANG=fr_FR.UTF8 ./sage -bt src/sage/misc/cython.py
```

It happens to contain a test in which `gcc` is run, producing an error, which is wrapped in a `RuntimeError`.  If the French localization of gcc is available then the error message contains unicode (in this case utf-8 encoded) characters that do not get decoded.

I thought of adding a regression test, but given that it's a huge pain to write one for the doctest framework, and that it's Python 2 only, I hope to get away without it.
