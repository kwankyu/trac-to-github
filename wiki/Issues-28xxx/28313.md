Some files in notebook-5.7.6.tar.gz contains relative link.

`./notebook/static/style/ipython.min.css.map` and `./notebook/static/style/style.min.css.map`

Those files are not part of the official notebook release. It may be caused by an error in the building process.

This triggers error in Firefox (at least), when it tries to load files like:
`http://localhost:8888/Users/benjaminrk/dev/jpy/security/notebook/static/notebook/less/modal.less`

What are the reasons not to use Jupyter release ?

Depends on #26919

**Keywords:** jupyter
