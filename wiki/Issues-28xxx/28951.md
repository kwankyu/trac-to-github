This fixes the following error

```
/Applications/sage-dev/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/schemes/cyclic_covers/charpoly_frobenius.pyc in charpoly_frobenius(frob_matrix, charpoly_prec, p, weight, a, known_factor)
    220         if known_factor != [1]:
    221             raise NotImplementedError()
--> 222         for i in range(degree / 2):
    223             p_power = p**min(
    224                 charpoly_prec[i],

TypeError: range() integer end argument expected, got float.
```

and I also add a test, to verify that the bug has been fixed.

This is not equivalent:

```diff
-    halfdegree = ceil(degree / 2) + 1
+    halfdegree = degree // 2 + 1
```
Instead you have you use

```python
    halfdegree = (degree + 1) // 2 + 1
```
Also, does the test matrix need to be so big?

I looked into this for a bit today. After rebasing, this works as expected. But there is one aspect I don't understand, related to what tscrim pointed out before.

I notice the current tests pass when the line 

```python
halfdegree = degree // 2 + 1
```

is replaced by the line

```python
halfdegree = (degree + 1) // 2 + 1
```

but not with either `(degree - 1)//2 + 1` or `(degree + 2)//2 + 1`. Thus sometimes the function behaves largely the same even when `halfdegree` differs by 1, but not always. I didn't track this dependence on parity, but this surprises me a little bit.

0- I have replaced the original example with a smaller example.

1- I have replaced the original `degree/2` with `(degree + 1)//2`, as I'm comparing the ith coefficient and  (degree - i)th coefficient to figure out the sign of functional equation.
In the case that degree is even, I don't want to compare the middle coefficient against itself.
So, if `degree=2n` the loop ranges over `0,...,n-1`, and if `degree=2n+1`, the degree loops over `0, ..., n`.

2- I replaced `halfdegree = ceil(degree / 2) + 1` with `degree // 2 + 1`. This is the number 
of coefficients that we will compute, so if `degree=2n` or `degree=2n+1` we will compute the coefficients `0, ...,n`. In the previous version we were unecessarily computing one extra coefficient.

There is a new division by two in the power of p :

```
p**(a * degree * weight / 2)
```
maybe it could use an exact division `//` ?
