Someone with the user name `dhagrow` uploaded a package `sage`, version 0.0.0, to PyPI in 2018. The package provides no description nor contact information. This is harmless, but could cause confusion. 

Python packages may want to declare `sage` as a dependency in their `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` - as this is the name of the Python package for the Sage library defined in `SAGEROOT/src/setup.py`.
