Currently Bland's rule is hardcoded in `run_simplex_method`.

```
            if self.entering() is None:
                self.enter(min(self.possible_entering()))
            if self.leaving() is None:
                possible = self.possible_leaving()
                if possible:
                    self.leave(min(possible))
```

This should be refactored so that there are methods to pick according to a pivot rule.

For flexibility, a pivot rule should be an object that can be passed to any `LPAbstractDictionary` and is in charge of the selection. For most purposes, this could be a singleton instance of a class.
