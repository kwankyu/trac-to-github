Transposing a matrix preserves its block structure:

```
sage: A = matrix(RDF, 2, 3); A.subdivide([1], [1]); A
⎛0.0│0.0 0.0⎞
⎜───┼───────⎟
⎝0.0│0.0 0.0⎠
sage: A.T
⎛0.0│0.0⎞
⎜───┼───⎟
⎜0.0│0.0⎟
⎝0.0│0.0⎠
```
The same should be the case for the conjugation and Hermitian transpose:

```
sage: A.H
⎛0.0 0.0⎞
⎜0.0 0.0⎟
⎝0.0 0.0⎠
sage: A.C
⎛0.0 0.0 0.0⎞
⎝0.0 0.0 0.0⎠
```

Component: **linear algebra**

Keywords: **block_matrix**
