Since #29766 I cannot build Numpy 1.19.1 on Cygwin, specifically with AVX enabled, due to this issue in Numpy (actually caused by a bug in GCC < 8.4): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/16290


I've been meaning to work on this issue anyways, so I'll see if I can find a clean workaround.  If not, it also works to pass some CFLAGS to the Numpy build as noted on the upstream issues.

It is a problem with GCC<8.4.

I started on a patch to Numpy the week before last but hit a snag before I was able to finish it.  Then I went on vacation :P

An ugly but acceptable workaround is also to set

```
CFLAGS=-ffixed-xmm16 -ffixed-xmm17 -ffixed-xmm18 -ffixed-xmm19 -ffixed-xmm20 -ffixed-xmm21 -ffixed-xmm22 -ffixed-xmm23 -ffixed-xmm24 -ffixed-xmm25 -ffixed-xmm26 -ffixed-xmm27 -ffixed-xmm28 -ffixed-xmm29 -ffixed-xmm30 -ffixed-xmm31
```

when compiling Numpy.

Current cygwin has gcc 10.2. 

I would suggest to limit support of a from-source build of Sage on Cygwin to the latest Cygwin version and encourage users to update Cygwin.

(Does cygwin even have a supported way to install an older version of the distribution?)
