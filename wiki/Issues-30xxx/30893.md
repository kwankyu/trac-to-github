Replaces sage's custom autodoc extension by the built-in one. The motivation is to add support for typing information in the documentation in #30894.

The following customizations need to be removed for this:

- providing argspecs for decorators (sage_wraps): #30884
- using argspecs instead of signature 
- dealing with cached function(methods) callers
- dealing with nested classes
- dealing with classcall metaclass
- dealing with class aliases
- skipping lazy imports to avoid deprecation warnings








Depends on #30884

Building the docs fails immediately for me, because text roles like `:arxiv:`, `:trac:`, etc. are no longer defined.

I think it would be better, at least as a first step, to update `sage_autodoc` to incorporate the recent changes in Sphinx's `autodoc`.

That should be fixed now.

I will do so! I just figured out how to convince sage to produce the documentation for something else then the manifold package. After playing around a bit, I realized that there might be quite some changes necessary (e.g. `instancedoc` doesn't play nicely with Python's `inspect`). Will keep you updated.
