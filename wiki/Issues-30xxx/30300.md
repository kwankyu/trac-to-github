It looks that this uses only the method `keys()`, which can be defined without any reference to `AbstractFamily`. However, I understand that the inheritance from `AbstractFamily`  makes the bases of `FiniteRankFreeModule`'s more similar to those of other free modules in Sage, which is certainly a good thing => positive review from my side.
