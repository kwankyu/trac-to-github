(from #30184)

From https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

```
Warning

Combining older versions of pybind11 (< 2.6.0) with the brand-new Python 3.9.0 will trigger undefined behavior that typically manifests as crashes during interpreter shutdown (but could also destroy your data. You have been warned.)

We recommend that you wait for Python 3.9.1 slated for release in December, which will include a fix that resolves this problem. In the meantime, please update to the latest version of pybind11 (2.6.0 or newer), which includes a temporary workaround specifically when Python 3.9.0 is detected at runtime.
```

`pybind11` is a dependency of `scipy`.
