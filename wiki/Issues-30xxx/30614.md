This ticket proposes allowing the user to customize the size, font, and opacity as well as the bold/italic styling for [text3d](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes2.html#sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2.text3d) displayed in the Three.js viewer.

Additionally, the font option should support CSS font fallback by providing an array of font names or a string of comma-separated font names.

> > - Renames font options to be consistent with 2D options: `fontfamily`, `fontsize`, `fontstyle`, and `fontweight` (although `fontfamily` doesn't seem to exist in 2D text)
> > - Supports the same integer and keyword weights as 2D text: `book`, `extra bold`, etc.
> > - Supports the same keyword sizes as 2D text: `large`, `x-large`, etc.
> > - Makes sure font options carry over from 2D text when calling `plot3d` on the text

> Thanks for taking this into account. It's indeed important to have consistency with 2D nomenclature.
