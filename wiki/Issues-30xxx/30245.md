It inherits `_add_` and `_sub_` methods that make no sense in the coercion system. These methods are guaranteed by the coercion system to get elements of the parent, and are supposed to give elements as well:

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 2, name='M')
sage: G = M.general_linear_group()
sage: T11 = M.tensor_module(1, 1)
sage: from sage.structure.coerce import CoercionModel
sage: cm = CoercionModel()
sage: cm.explain(G, G, operator.add)
Identical parents, arithmetic performed immediately.
Result lives in General linear group of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
General linear group of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
```

Also other operations inherited from the module are problematic because they are not type-stable. The result of operations is supposed to depend only on the parents of the operands, but:

```
sage: cm.explain(ZZ, G, operator.mul)
Action discovered.
    Left Integer Multiplication by Integer Ring on General linear group of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
Result lives in General linear group of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
General linear group of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
sage: a = G.an_element()
sage: 2 * a
Type-(1,1) tensor on the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
sage: -a
Automorphism of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
sage: (-1)*a
Automorphism of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
sage: 0 *a
Automorphism of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
```
(Note in particular the scary last one...)

There is already a coercion map from `FreeModuleLinearGroup`, sending a `FreeModuleAutomorphism` to the underlying tensor:

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 2, name='M')
sage: G = M.general_linear_group()
sage: T11 = M.tensor_module(1, 1)
sage: T11.coerce_map_from(G)
Coercion map:
  From: General linear group of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
  To:   Free module of type-(1,1) tensors on the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring
sage: _.category()
Category of elements of Set of Morphisms from General linear group of the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring to Free module of type-(1,1) tensors on the Rank-2 free module M over the Integer Ring in Category of sets
```
This coercion can handle all of the module operations if we let it.

In this ticket, we change the relationship of `FreeModuleAutomorphism` and `FreeModuleTensor` from "is-a" to "has-a".


Making this change will also allow us to simplify `FreeModuleTensor._add_` and `_sub_`: Currently they go through `self._fmodule.tensor_from_comp()` when they really should use `self._new_instance`.

Indeed, at this stage, `self._fmodule.tensor_from_comp()` is still required in `FreeModuleTensor._add_()` because it deals properly with the tensor (anti)symmetries, via the code of `CompWithSym.__add__()`. For instance, if `t1` is a (4,0)-tensor with that is fully symmetric, and `t2` is a (4,0)-tensor that is symmetric on the first two indices and antisymmetric on the last two ones, `t1 + t2` is symmetric only on the first two indices, i.e. its (anti)symmetries are different from those of `t1` or `t2`. They thus cannot be generated by `self._new_instance` (in the current stage).
