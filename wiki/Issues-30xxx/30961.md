Before this ticket, lists of elements with arbitrary parents were accepted:

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: QQi = i.parent()
sage: QQi((x, x))
(I + 1)*x
```

However, some lists that arguably should be accepted for consistency were not:

```
sage: QQi("1")
1
sage: QQi(("1", "2"))
...
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element_quadratic.NumberFieldElement_gaussian'
```

Additionally, lists and vector inputs behaved differently for no clear reason:

```
sage: QQi(RR(1))
1
sage: QQi((RR(1), RR(2)))
1.00000000000000 + 2.00000000000000*I
sage: _.parent()
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: QQi(vector((RR(1), RR(2))))
...
TypeError: unable to convert (1.00000000000000, 2.00000000000000) to Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with I = 1*I
```
