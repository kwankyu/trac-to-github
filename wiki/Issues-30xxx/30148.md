Noticed while doing something else:

```
$ make download
export SAGE_ROOT=$(pwd) && \
export PATH=$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin:$PATH && \
./src/bin/sage-download-upstream
./src/bin/sage-download-upstream: line 6: sage-spkg: command not found
./src/bin/sage-download-upstream: line 6: sage-spkg: command not found
...
make: *** [Makefile:69: download] Error 127
```

Component: **build**
