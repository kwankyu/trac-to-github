I use the archlinux package sagemath version 9.2.1 and the `show` function does not work, at least, for `OrderedTree` and `BinaryTree`.

The errors seems to come from the lack of a MathJax file:

Using the Sage REPL, or Jupyter Notebook, or JupyterLab?
Does this code illustrate the problem?

That code is enough to illustrate the problem in Jupyter Notebook.

However, I didn't see the MathJax error anymore but the problem is still there (the tikz code is displayed instead of its rendering).

I also tried in the REPL and the same problem occurs.

But I can `show(graphs.PetersenGraph())` in the REPL and the Jupyter Notebook.

The tikz representation of Sage objects can be showed
by using `view` instead of `show`.

That produces a temporary pdf image and opens it
by launching an external pdf viewer.

The following works for me both in the
Sage REPL and in Jupyter Notebook.

```
sage: a = BinaryTree([])
sage: view(a)
```

```
sage: b = OrderedTree([])
sage: view(b)
```

```
sage: x = OrderedTree([])
sage: y = OrderedTree([x, x])
sage: z = OrderedTree([[],[]])
sage: t = OrderedTree([x, y, z])
sage: t
[[], [[], []], [[], []]]
sage: view(t)
```
This might not solve your problem, but may
hopefully work around it until it is solved.
