The optional package `gap_packages` fails to build on various platforms (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/281307759):
`ubuntu-trusty`, `debian-bullseye`, `debian-sid`, `linuxmint-17`.

We add patches extracted from the GAP/libsemigroup update ticket #29314 (which may not be ready for Sage 9.2)

I thusly approve the 1st four commits - I tested them.

I don't have a working install of XCode 12 now, as I updated by macOS to version 11, and the hell is breaking looser with each new beta there (I guess I can roll back to macOS 10.15...)

For what it's worth, `gap_packages` fails for me with Xcode 12, with the usual sort of error:

```
gcc -c -O -fno-builtin gpd.c
