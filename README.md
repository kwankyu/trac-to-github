What
=====

This script migrates milestones, issues/tickets, and wiki pages from Trac to GitHub.

The script has its origin at https://github.com/moimael/trac-to-gitlab,
which then has been [extended to suite a specific use case of SVN+Trac to GitLab migration](https://www.gams.com/~stefan/svn2git/).
Next, GitLab specific code has been removed and a migration to GitHub
has been added.

Features
--------
 * Title, description, comments to issues are copied over
 * Component, issue type, priority, severity, and keywords are converted to labels
 * Version and CC are added to the issue description
 * Resolution is added as comment
 * Issue text attachments are uploaded as Gist (GitHub doesn't allow to attach files to issues via the GitHub API)
   or all issue attachments are exported to files
 * References to SVN commits can be replaced by references to Githashes.
 * Wiki pages including attachments are exported into files that can be
   added to the GitHub project wiki repository.

Missing
-------
 * Wiki pages could automatically be added to a projects wiki repository.
 * History on wiki pages is not kept.


How
====

Migrating a Trac project to GitHub is a relatively complex process involving four steps:

 * Create a new project
 * Migrate the repository
 * Migrate issues and milestones
 * Migrate wiki pages

This script takes care of the third and fourth bullet points.

Usage:

  1. copy ```migrate.cfg.example``` to ```migrate.cfg```
  2. configure the values
  3. run (```./migrate.py```). Make sure you test it on a test project prior, if you run it twice against the same project you will get duplicated issues.
